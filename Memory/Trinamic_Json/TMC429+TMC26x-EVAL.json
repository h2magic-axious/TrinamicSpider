{"model": "TMC429+TMC26x-EVAL", "excerpt": "The evaluation board TMC429+TMC26x-EVAL provides an excellent, simple and cost efficient device to explore the latest generation of TRINAMIC stepper motor chipsets. The board contains the 3-axes motion controller TMC429, the three CoolStep\u2122 stepper motor drivers TMC260, TMC261\u00a0and TMC262\u00a0as well as the incremental encoder interface TMC424.You will learn everything about the usage and features of the chipset (CoolStep\u2122, StallGuard2\u2122, 256x \u00b5stepping, SpreadCycle chopper, etc.) and get the possibility to explore your stepper motor motion control application. The evaluation PC-software gives access to every single bit of the chipset. Communication is possible either via USB (virtual COM port) or via RS232.The TMC429+TMC26x-EVAL is a complete \u201cplug and play\u201d solution. It comes with the evaluation software, a USB cable and all relevant pluggable screw connectors. Additionally only a PC, one to three stepper motors and a power supply are required.Special FeaturesStallGuard2\u2122CoolStep\u2122SpreadCycle\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Motor Supply": "12\u202648V", "Phase Current, RMS": "1.4A", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "RS232": "Yes", "USB": "Yes", "StallGuard2\u2122": "Yes", "CoolStep\u2122": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Images/TMC429_TMC26x-EVAL.jpg", "images": null, "resource": {"Datasheet": [["EVAL Manual", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Documents/TMC429_TMC26x-EVAL_Manual.pdf"]], "Drawings": [["Layout Data (PDF) V2.0", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Drawings/TMC429_TMC26x-EVAL-Layout_Data_V2.0.zip"]], "Software": [["TMC429-TM26x-EVAL source", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Software/TMC429_TMC26x-EVAL-source.zip"], ["TMC429-TMC26x-EVAL", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Software/TMC429_TMC26x-EVAL.zip"]]}}
