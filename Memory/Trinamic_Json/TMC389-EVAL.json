{"model": "TMC389-EVAL", "excerpt": "The TMC389-EVAL allows you to explore all functions of the\u00a0TMC389-LA\u00a0with external power MOSFETs plus a microcontroller, which allows interfacing to a PC for visualization and control of all parameters. The motor can be operated via the step and direction interface, using either an external source, or using the integrated microcontroller as a step pulse generator.The TMC389-Eval is a complete \"plug and play\" solution. All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data. All settings can simply be exported for your own firmware project.More about the TMCL-IDESpecial FeaturesCoolStep\u2122StallGuard2\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Motor Supply": "9\u202660V", "Phase Current, RMS": "2.52A", "Microsteps": "1\u2026171", "RS232": "Yes", "SPI": "Yes", "Step/Dir": "Yes", "USB": "Yes", "CoolStep\u2122": "Yes", "StallGuard2\u2122": "Yes"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Images/TMC389-EVAL.jpg", "images": null, "resource": {"Datasheet": [["TMC389 Datasheet", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC389_Datasheet.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["TMC389-EVAL Manual", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Documents/TMC389-EVAL_manual.pdf"]], "Drawings": [["Layout Data (PDF) V1.0", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Drawings/TMC389-EVAL-Layout_Data_V1.0.zip"]], "Software": [["Setup information and applications", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Software/TMC389-EVAL.zip"], ["Firmware", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Software/Eval389_Firmware.zip"]]}}
