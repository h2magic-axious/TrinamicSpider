{"model": "TMC2300-THERMO-BOB", "excerpt": "Building your smart thermostatic radiator valve (TRV) is easy with Trinamic's open-source design. The TMC2300-THERMO-BOB allows you to develop a quiet and energy-efficient TRVs with sensorless homing. It uses the TMC2300 low voltage stepper motor driver with StealthChop2\u2122 for silent motor operation. The TMC2300-THERMO-BOB has an onboard Goot stepper motor with 1.5V/1A and provides an interface to the Microchip PIC-IoT Board.Special FeaturesMicroPlyer\u2122CoolStep\u2122StealthChop2\u2122StallGuard4\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Motor Supply": "2\u202611V", "Phase Current, RMS": "1.2A", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "Step/Dir": "Yes", "MicroPlyer\u2122": "Yes", "CoolStep\u2122": "Yes", "StealthChop2\u2122": "Yes", "StallGuard4\u2122": "Yes"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Images/TMC2300-THERMO-BOB_Top.jpg", "images": null, "resource": {"Datasheet": [["TMC2300-THERMO-BOB Datasheet", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Documents/TMC2300-Thermo-BOB_datasheet_Rev1.00.pdf"], ["TMC2300 Datasheet", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC2300_Datasheet_V104.pdf"]], "Drawings": [["TMC2300-THERMO-BOB STEP-File", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Drawings/TMC2300-THERMO-BOB_v1.2.step"]]}}
