{"model": "TMC5072-EVAL", "excerpt": "The TMC5072-EVAL allows you to explore all functions of the TMC5072-LA.The TMC5072-EVAL-KIT is a set of one MCU board Landungsbr\u00fccke, an Eselsbr\u00fccke bridge board and one TMC5072-EVAL driver board. It allows for a quick and simple start within only minutes to make your motor turning, while still providing full access to all registers and full functionality and diagnostics.For diagnosis, all signals between MCU and TMC5072 are accessible with probes on the Eselsbr\u00fccke bridge board. To simplify the transfer to your own processor platform the MCU board can be disconnected.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data. All settings can simply be exported for your own firmware project.More about the TMCL-IDESpecial FeaturesDcStep\u2122microstep tableStallGuard2\u2122SpreadCycle\u2122StealthChop\u2122short detection", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Motor Supply": "7\u202624V", "Phase Current, RMS": "1.1A", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "a/b/n incremental": "Yes", "SPI": "Yes", "USB": "Yes", "DcStep\u2122": "Yes", "microstep table": "Yes", "StallGuard2\u2122": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "StealthChop\u2122": "Yes", "short detection": "Yes"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Images/TMC5072-EVAL.jpg", "images": null, "resource": {"Datasheet": [["TMC5072 Datasheet", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC5072_datasheet_Rev1.23.pdf"]], "Drawings": [["EAGLE Files V1.0", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Drawings/TMC5072-Eval_v10-EAGLE.zip"], ["GERBER Files V1.0", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Drawings/TMC5072-Eval_v10-gerber.zip"], ["Layout Data (PDF) V1.0", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Drawings/TMC5072-Eval_v10_LayoutData-pdf.zip"]], "Software": [["UART Files V1.0", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Software/TMC5072-EVAL_UART.zip"]], "Application Notes": [["AN039 - Arduino via Single Wire UART", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Appnotes/AN039_Arduino_UART_TMC5072-EVAL_0v10_20170220.pdf"]]}}
