{"model": "MONOpack 2 V2", "excerpt": "The MONOpack 2 V2 is a highly integrated stepper motor controller unit in a small and robust housing. It provides a high motor power and dynamics. A variety of control interfaces and protocols provide a simple means of remote control or stand alone functionality for all purposes. Its optional incremental encoder feedback and a number of protection features makes drives very dependant and reliable.In terms of software and current settings the new MONOpack 2 is fully compatible with the old MONOpack and MONOpack LT while providing a number of enhanced features.The newest version V2 is ROHS compliant and has a new \"resonance avoiding high velocity feature\".All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data.More about the TMCL-IDESpecial FeaturesStallGuard\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "1", "Motor Supply": "12\u202648V", "Phase Current, RMS": "3.5A", "Microsteps": "406", "CAN": "Yes", "RS422": "Yes", "RS485": "Yes", "Step/Dir": "Yes", "TMCL\u2122": "Yes", "S-shaped": "Yes", "StallGuard\u2122": "Yes", "Width": "130mm", "Length": "132mm", "Height": "45mm"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Images/Monopack_2.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Blockdiagrams/Monopack_2_Blockdiagramm.svg", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Pinouts/Monopack_2v2.svg"], "resource": {"Documentation": [["Hardware Manual Rev 1.04", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/MONOpack_2_manual_rev1.04.pdf"]], "Software": [["Mono control 2.exe", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/MonoControl2.exe"], ["Firmware V2.26", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/MPII_V226.hex"], ["Firmware TMCL V3.36", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCL-MP_V336.hex"]]}}
