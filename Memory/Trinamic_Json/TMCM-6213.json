{"model": "TMCM-6213", "excerpt": "The TMCM-6213 is a sextuple axis stepper motor controller/driver module for sensorless load dependent current control. The device is powered by Trinamic StallGuard2\u2122, CoolStep\u2122, SpreadCycle\u2122, StealthChop\u2122 and DcStep\u2122 technology and has a SixPoint\u2122 ramp generator. The TMCM-6213 is capable of driving up to 1.5A peak of current from each output (with proper heatsinking). It is designed for an operating voltage of 11...35V. The device provides a USB, EtherCAT and 6 encoder interfaces. An integrated protocol processor supplies a high level CANopen over EtherCAT communication.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data.More about the TMCL-IDESpecial FeaturesDcStep\u2122MicroPlyer\u2122CoolStep\u2122SpreadCycle\u2122StallGuard2\u2122StealthChop\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "6", "Motor Supply": "11\u202635V", "Phase Current, RMS": "1.1A", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "a/b/n incremental": "Yes", "EtherCAT\u00ae": "Yes", "USB": "Yes", "CoE": "Yes", "SixPoint\u2122": "Yes", "DcStep\u2122": "Yes", "MicroPlyer\u2122": "Yes", "CoolStep\u2122": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "StallGuard2\u2122": "Yes", "StealthChop\u2122": "Yes", "Width": "215mm", "Length": "100mm", "Height": "21mm"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Images/TMCM-6213.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Blockdiagrams/TMCM-6213.svg"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Hardware Manual Rev 1.01", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-6212_hardware_manual_hw1.10_rev1.01.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["CoE Firmware Manual FW V1.09 Rev 1.08", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-6213_CoE_firmware_manual_fw1.09_rev1.08_01.pdf"], ["CoE Firmware Manual FW V1.07 Rev 1.05", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-6213_CoE_firmware_manual_Fw1.07_Rev1.05.pdf"], ["CoE Firmware Manual FW V1.01 Rev 1.04", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-6213_CoE-firmware_manual_Fw1.01_Rev1.04.pdf"]], "Software": [["Firmware CoE V1.09", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-6213-CoE_V109.zip"], ["Firmware CoE V1.07", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-6213_CoE_V107.zip"], ["Firmware CoE V1.01", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-6213-CoE_V101.zip"]], "Drawings": [["TMCM-6213 STEP-File V1.1", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Drawings/TMCM-6213_v11.zip"]], "PCNs": [["PCN 2019-06-02 CoE Firmware V1.09", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/PCN_2019-06-02_Firmware_V109_CoE.pdf"], ["PCN 2018-03-04 CoE Firmware V1.07", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/PCN_2018-03-04_Firmware_CoE_V107.pdf"]]}}
