{"model": "TMC2041-LA", "excerpt": "The TMC2041 provides an integrated motor driver solution for 3D-Printing, Cameras, Scanners and other automated equipment applications. The device has an integrated microstepping indexer, the sensorless stall detection technology StallGuard2\u2122, the sensorless load dependent current control CoolStep\u2122 and is intended to drive a bipolar stepper motor. The output driver block consists of low RDSon N-Channel power MOSFETs configured as full H-bridges to drive the motor windings. The TMC2041 is capable of driving up to 1.5A of current from each output (with proper heatsinking). TMC2041 is designed for a supply voltage of 5...26V. The device has a SPI interface for configuration and diagnostics and a step and direction interface.Special FeaturesMicroPlyer\u2122CoolStep\u2122SpreadCycle\u2122StallGuard2\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "2", "Motor Supply": "5\u202626V", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "SPI": "Yes", "Step/Dir": "Yes", "UART": "Yes", "MicroPlyer\u2122": "Yes", "CoolStep\u2122": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "StallGuard2\u2122": "Yes", "Phase Current, RMS": "1.1A", "Package": "QFN48 (7x7)"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Images/tmc2041-la.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Blockdiagrams/TMC2041-V2.svg", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Pinouts/TMC2041.svg"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Datasheet Rev 1.03", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC2041_datasheet_Rev1.03.pdf"]], "Quality": [["Statement concerning RoHS compliance of TMC2041", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Company/Quality/RoHS_ICs/TMC2041_RoHS.pdf"]], "Application Notes": [["AN 005k - PCB Footprint Guidelines QFN48 7x7", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/AN005k-IC_Package_PCB_Footprint_Guidelines_QFN48_7x7.pdf"]], "Additional Resources": [["Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)", "https://trinamic.comhttps://www.trinamic.com/support/faq/"], ["Application Programming Interface (API)", "https://trinamic.comhttps://www.trinamic.com/support/software/access-package/"]]}}
