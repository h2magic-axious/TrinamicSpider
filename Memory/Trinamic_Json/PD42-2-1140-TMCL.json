{"model": "PD42-2-1140-TMCL", "excerpt": "The PANdrive PD-1140 family is a mechatronic solution including a 40mm flange stepper motor, a controller board and a SensOstep\u2122 encoder. It can be controlled via serial interface or operated in standalone mode. Power supply, external encoder, interface and I/Os can be connected with JST connectors.With the advanced StallGuard2\u2122 the motor load can be detected with high resolution. The outstanding CoolStep\u2122 technology for sensorless load dependent current control allows efficient motor operation.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data.More about the TMCL-IDESpecial FeaturesStallGuard2\u2122CoolStep\u2122SpreadCycle\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Flange NEMA": "17", "Flange": "42mm", "Holding Torque": "36Ncm", "Motor Supply": "9\u202628V", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "CAN": "Yes", "RS485": "Yes", "USB": "Yes", "SensOstep\u2122": "Yes", "TMCL\u2122": "Yes", "CANopen": "", "trapezoidal": "Yes", "StallGuard2\u2122": "Yes", "CoolStep\u2122": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "Width": "42mm", "Height": "42mm", "Length": "51mm"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Images/PD42-2-1140.jpg", "images": null, "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Hardware Manual Rev 1.03", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Documents/PD-1140_hardware_manual_hw1.30_rev1.03.pdf"], ["Short Specification", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Documents/PD-1140_ShortSpec.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["Getting started", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Documents/PD-1140_getting_started.pdf"], ["TMCL Firmware Manual Revision V1.05 for Firmware V1.42", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Documents/PD42-1140_TMCL-firmware_manual_Fw1.42_Rev1.05.pdf"], ["TMCL Firmware Manual Revision V1.03 for Firmware V1.27", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Documents/PD-1140_TMCL_firmware_manual.pdf"], ["CANopen Firmware Manual FW V3.20 Rev 2.11", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Documents/PD-1140-CANopen_firmware_manual_fw3.20_rev2.11.pdf"]], "Software": [["Setup Information (Trinamic_inf_cat)", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Software/Trinamic_inf_cat.zip"], ["CANopen Firmware V3.20", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1140_CANopen_V320.zip"], ["TMCL Firmware V1.42", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1140_V142.hex"], ["TMCL Firmware V1.27", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1140_V127.hex"]], "PCNs": [["PCN-2017-07-02 - TMCL Firmware V1.42", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/PCNs/PCN_2017-07-02_Firmware_V142.pdf"], ["PCN-2017-07-04 - CANopen Firmware V3.20", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/PCNs/PCN_2017-07-04_Firmware_V320.pdf"], ["PCN-2016-01-02 - Hardware Change", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/EOL_PCN/PCN_2016-01-02_TMCM-1140.pdf"], ["PCN-2013-09-30 - TMCL Firmware V1.27", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/EOL_PCN/2013_09_03_pcn_Firmware_V127.pdf"]], "Drawings": [["PD42-1-1140 STEP-File", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Drawings/PD42-1-1140.stp"], ["PD42-2-1140 STEP-File", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Drawings/PD42-2-1140.stp"], ["PD42-3-1140 STEP-File", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Drawings/PD42-3-1140.stp"], ["PD42-4-1140 STEP-File", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Drawings/PD42-4-1140.stp"]]}}
