{"model": "TMC262-LA", "excerpt": "The TMC262 is an integrated stepper motor predriver solution for Laboratory Automation, 3D-Printing, Scanners and other automated equipment applications. The device is capable of driving up to a gate current of 40mA and is powered by Trinamic StallGuard2\u2122, CoolStep\u2122, SpreadCycle\u2122, MicroPlyer\u2122 technology. TMC262 is designed for a supply voltage of 9...60V. The device provides a SPI and S/D interface.The new TMC262C improves motor silence and adds low side short protection. The C-version is recommended for new designs.Special FeaturesMicroPlyer\u2122StallGuard2\u2122CoolStep\u2122SpreadCycle\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "1", "Motor Supply": "9\u202660V", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "SPI": "Yes", "Step/Dir": "Yes", "MicroPlyer\u2122": "Yes", "StallGuard2\u2122": "Yes", "CoolStep\u2122": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "Package": "QFN32 (5x5)"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Images/tmc262-la.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Blockdiagrams/TMC262-LA-V2.svg", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Pinouts/TMC262-LA.svg"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["TMC262 + TMC262C Datasheet", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC262_TMC262C_datasheet_Rev2.25.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["Getting Started", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC262_Getting_Started.pdf"], ["Power Dissipation Calculation", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC262_calculations.xls"], ["Rsense and Current Calculation", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC262_Rsense_and_Current_Calculation.xlsx"]], "Application Notes": [["AN006 - N and P Power Stages", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Appnotes/AN006-N_and_P_power_stages.pdf"], ["AN011 - Good Ground Connection", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Appnotes/AN011_Good_Ground_Connection.pdf"], ["AN016 - TMC429 TMC26x Getting Started: Motion Control via S/D", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Appnotes/AN016_TMC429_TMC26x_Getting_Started_01.pdf"], ["Application Note 005g - QFN32 (5x5)", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/AN005g-IC_Package_PCB_Footprint_Guidelines_QFN32_5x5.pdf"]], "Quality": [["Statement concerning RoHS compliance of TMC262", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Company/Quality/RoHS_ICs/TMC262_RoHS.pdf"]], "Drawings": [["TMC262 ECAD Symbol", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC262-ECAD_Rev1.00.zip"]]}}
