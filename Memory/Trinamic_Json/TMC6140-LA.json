{"model": "TMC6140-LA", "excerpt": "TMC6140 is a fully integrated universal 3-phase MOSFET gate driver for PMSM servo or BLDC motors. External MOSFETs for up to 100 A motor current are supported. Three bottom shunt amplifiers allow easy current sensing and enhanced commutation of the motor. A switching regulator (3.3 V, 0.5 A, internal Schottky diode for up to 100mA) generates enough power for the IOs and the micro controller. Further on, it can serve as step-up converter to stabilize statically the gate voltages of the MOSFETs. A DIAG output for further diagnostics and two different power down modes are available.Special Featuresbreak before makeshort detectionslope control", "fields": {"Status": "preview", "Axes": "1", "Motor Supply": "5\u202630V", "Microsteps": "", "UART": "Yes", "break before make": "Yes", "short detection": "Yes", "slope control": "Yes", "Phase Current, RMS": "1.0A", "Package": "QFN36 (5x6)"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Images/TMC6140-LA.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Blockdiagrams/TMC6140_Block_Diagram.svg"], "resource": {"Application Notes": [["AN 005i - PCB Footprint Guidelines QFN36 5x6", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Appnotes/AN005i-IC_Package_PCB_Footprint_Guidelines_QFN36_5x6.pdf"]]}}
