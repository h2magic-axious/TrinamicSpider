{"model": "TMCM-1321", "excerpt": "The TMCM-1321 is an easy to use, single axis controller/driver for 2-phase bipolar stepper motors with separate home and stop switch inputs. The built-in magnetic encoder can be used when a suitable magnet is attached to the motor axis, enabling also closed-loop operation. As an alternative, an optical encoder can be connected via digital ABN inputs. Different ramp shapes can be selected. Dynamic current control, and quiet, smooth and efficient operation are combined with StallGuard\u2122 and CoolStep\u2122 features.Special Featuresclosed loop controlDcStep\u2122ChopSync\u2122CoolStep\u2122SpreadCycle\u2122StallGuard2\u2122StealthChop\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "preview", "Axes": "1", "Motor Supply": "", "Phase Current, RMS": "", "Microsteps": "", "a/b/n incremental": "Yes", "RS485": "Yes", "SPI": "Yes", "TMCL\u2122": "Yes", "advanced S-shaped": "Yes", "SixPoint\u2122": "Yes", "trapezoidal": "Yes", "closed loop control": "Yes", "DcStep\u2122": "Yes", "ChopSync\u2122": "Yes", "CoolStep\u2122": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "StallGuard2\u2122": "Yes", "StealthChop\u2122": "Yes", "Width": "28mm", "Length": "28mm", "Height": ""}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/user_upload/TMCM-1321_V12.jpg", "images": null, "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Hardware Manuel", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/user_upload/TMCM-1321_hardware_manual_hw1.2_rev1.00.pdf"], ["Firmware Manuel", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/user_upload/TMCM-1321_TMCL_firmware_manual_fw1.39_rev1.00.pdf"]]}}
