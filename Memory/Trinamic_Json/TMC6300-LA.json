{"model": "TMC6300-LA", "excerpt": "Working from a single Li-Ion cell or dual AA batteries the TMC6300 is optimally suited for battery operated equipment. Operate a BLDC motor with block or sinecommutation using 6-line control from a CPU. Integrated power-MOSFETs handle motor current up to 2A. Protection and diagnostic features support robust and reliable operation. Its integrated chargepump for best-in-class RDSon and ultra-low standby current ensure best efficiency even at low supply voltage and longest battery life.Special Featuresbreak before make", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "1", "Motor Supply": "2\u202611V", "Microsteps": "", "break before make": "Yes", "Phase Current, RMS": "1.4A", "Package": "QFN20 (3x3)"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Images/TMC6300-LA.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Blockdiagrams/TMC6300_Block_Diagramm_01.svg", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Pinouts/6300_Pinout.png"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Datasheet Rev 1.04", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC6300_Datasheet_V104.pdf"]], "Additional Resources": [["Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)", "https://trinamic.comhttps://www.trinamic.com/support/faq/"], ["Application Programming Interface (API)", "https://trinamic.comhttps://www.trinamic.com/support/software/access-package/"]]}}
