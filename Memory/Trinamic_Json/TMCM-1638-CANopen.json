{"model": "TMCM-1638-CANopen", "excerpt": "The TMCM-1638 is a single axis field oriented motor controller/driver board. It supports single phase DC motors, two phase bipolar stepper motors and three phase BLDC motors with up to 7A RMS (10A peak) motor coil current. For motor commutation and position feedback, hall sensors or incremental ABN encoders can be used. For driver-only applications, the TMCM-1638 offers Step/Direction inputs. The TMCM-1638 is also equipped with two analog inputs (0... 5V range), two digital inputs and two digital (TTL level) outputs. For communication, RS485 and CAN bus interfaces are available.\u00a0The TMCM-1638 can either be used with TMCL firmware supporting standalone operation as well as direct mode control using the TMCL\u2122 protocol or with CANopen firmware supporting control using the CANopen\u00ae protocol.", "fields": {"Status": "preview", "Axes": "1", "Motor Supply": "10\u202652V", "a/b/n incremental": "Yes", "CAN": "Yes", "RS485": "Yes", "Step/Dir": "Yes", "GPIO": "Yes", "Digital Hall": "Yes", "CANopen": "Yes", "TMCL\u2122": "", "Width": "", "Length": "", "Height": ""}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Images/TMCM-1638_V11.jpg", "images": null, "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Hardware Manual", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1638_hardware_manual_hw1.1_rev1.01.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["TMCL Firmware Manual for Firmware V1.09", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1638_TMCL_firmware_manual_fw1.09_rev1.00.pdf"], ["CANopen Firmware Manual for Firmware V1.09", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1638_CANopen_firmware_manual_fw1.09_rev1.00.pdf"]], "Software": [["TMCL Firmware V1.09", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1638_TMCL_V109.hex"], ["CANopen Firmware V1.09", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1638_CANopen_V109.zip"]]}}
