{"model": "TMCM-BB4", "excerpt": "The TMCM-BB1 and TMCM-BB4 are BaseBoards for Trinamic\u2019s Slot Type Modules. TMCM-BB1 is a single-axis board and provides access to one MCU Module and one Driver Module. TMCM-BB4 is a 4-axis board and provides access to 4 + 1 modules slots. The single 36-pin PCI socket is available for the TMCM-0930 module, the main MCU (ARM Cortex-M4) module for the whole system. Other (four) 98-pin PCI socket is accessible for Slot Type motor driver Modules, available as stepper (TMCM-1230; TMCM-1231) or BLDC (TMCM-1637; TMCM-1638) versions. This BaseBoard comes with communication interface options like CAN; RS485 and USB-C, plus separate GPIO headers for both insertable modules.", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "4", "CAN": "Yes", "RS485": "Yes", "USB": "Yes", "GPIO": "Yes"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Images/TMCM-BB4.jpg", "images": null, "resource": {"Datasheet": [["TMCM-BB1 Hardware Manual", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-BB1_hardware_manual_Hw1.1_Rev1.00.pdf"], ["TMCM-BB4 Hardware Manual", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-BB4_hardware_manual_Hw1.1_Rev1.00.pdf"]], "Drawings": [["TMCM-BB1 Step Files V1.1", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Drawings/TMCM-BB1_V11_STEP.zip"], ["TMCM-BB4 Step Files V1.1", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Drawings/TMCM-BB4_V11_STEP.zip"]]}}
