{"model": "TMC8670-EVAL", "excerpt": "The TMC8670-EVAL allows you to explore all functions of the TMC8670-BI.The TMC8670+TMC-UPS-2A24V-EVAL-KIT is a set of one power stageTMC-UPS-2A24V-EVAL, an Eselsbr\u00fccke bridge board and one TMC8670-EVAL driver board. It allows for a quick and simple start within only minutes to make your motor turning, while still providing full access to all registers and full functionality and diagnostics.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data. All settings can simply be exported for your own firmware project.More about the TMCL-IDESpecial FeaturesFOCdual encoder", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Motor Supply": "", "Phase Current, RMS": "", "Microsteps": "", "a/b/n incremental": "Yes", "RMII (EtherCAT\u00ae)": "Yes", "SPI": "Yes", "UART": "Yes", "CoE": "Yes", "FOC": "Yes", "dual encoder": "Yes"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Images/TMC8670-EVAL_hrighres2.jpg", "images": null, "resource": {"Datasheet": [["TMC8670 Datasheet", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC8670_datasheet_rev1.00.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["TMC8670-EVAL BOM Files V1.1", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Documents/TMC8670-EVAL-BOM_Files_V1.1.zip"]], "Drawings": [["PCB Info", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Drawings/TMC8670-EVAL-PCB_Info.txt"], ["CAD Files V1.1", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Drawings/TMC8670-EVAL-CAD_Files_V1.1.zip"], ["GERBER Files V1.1", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Drawings/TMC8670-EVAL-GERBER_Files_V1.1.zip"], ["Layout Data (PDF) V1.1", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Drawings/TMC8670-EVAL-Layout_Design_V1.1.zip"]]}}
