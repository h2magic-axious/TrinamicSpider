{"model": "TMCM-1633", "excerpt": "The TMCM-1633 is a single axis controller module for brushless DC (BLDC) and PMSM motors. It offers field-oriented control (FOC) with up to 10A RMS phase currents at +48V DC supply. Besides hall sensor and incremental a/b/n encoder interfaces for connection to the motor, digital inputs and outputs can be used. A CAN interface allows communication with a CANopen master.The TMCM-1633 is compatible with Trinamic's baseboard BB-163x.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data.More about the TMCL-IDESpecial Featuresbreak before makeshort detectionslope controlCurrent Sense", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "1", "Motor Supply": "14.5\u202648V", "Phase Current, RMS": "10.0A", "Microsteps": "", "a/b/n incremental": "Yes", "CAN": "Yes", "RS232": "Yes", "Digital Hall": "Yes", "CANopen": "Yes", "trapezoidal": "Yes", "break before make": "Yes", "short detection": "Yes", "slope control": "Yes", "Current Sense": "Yes", "Width": "92mm", "Length": "50mm", "Height": "14mm"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Images/TMCM-1633.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Blockdiagrams/TMCM-1633.svg"], "resource": {"Documentation": [["Hardware Manual Rev 1.01", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1633_hardware_manual_hw1.00_rev1.01.pdf"], ["CANopen Firmware Manual FW V2.10 Rev 1.01", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1633-CANopen_firmware_manual_fw2.10_rev1.01.pdf"], ["CANopen Firmware Manual FW V2.09 Rev 1.00", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1633_CANopen_Firmware_Manual_V1.00.pdf"]], "Software": [["CANopen Firmware V2.10 (hex and EDS file)", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1633-CANopen_hw_v1.00_fw_v2.10.zip"], ["CANopen Firmware V2.09 (hex and EDS file)", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1633-CANopen_hw_v1.0_fw_v2.09.zip"]], "PCNs": [["PCN-2018-04-01 Firmware V2.10", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/PCN_2018-04-01_Firmware_V210.pdf"]], "Drawings": [["STEP-File V3.0", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Drawings/TMCM-1633_v3.step"]]}}
