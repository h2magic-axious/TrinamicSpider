{"model": "TMCM-343", "excerpt": "TMCM-343 is a compact and versatile triple axis 2-phase stepper motor controller and driver module. It provides a complete motion control solution at a very small size for embedded applications. Using the integrated additional I/Os it even can do complete system control applications. The board can be connected to a baseboard or customized electronics with a pin connector. TMCM-343-TMCL comes with the PC based software development environment TMCL-IDE. Using predefined TMCL\u2122 (Trinamic Motion Control Language) high level commands like \"move to position\" or \"constant rotation\" rapid and fast development of motion control applications is guaranteed. Host communication is possible via the serial UART interface (e.g. using a RS-232 or RS-485 level shifter) or via CAN. A user TMCL program can be stored in the on board EEPROM for stand-alone operation. With TMCM-343-CANopen it is possible to operate the module in CANopen networks together with other equipment. All time critical operations, e.g. ramp calculation are performed on board. With the StallGuard\u2122 feature it is possible to detect overload and stall of the motor. The firmware of the module can be updated via the serial interface.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data.More about the TMCL-IDESpecial FeaturesStallGuard\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "3", "Motor Supply": "7\u202634V", "Phase Current, RMS": "1.1A", "Microsteps": "1\u202664", "CAN": "Yes", "UART": "Yes", "CANopen": "Yes", "TMCL\u2122": "Yes", "trapezoidal": "Yes", "StallGuard\u2122": "Yes", "Width": "80mm", "Length": "55mm", "Height": "8mm"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Images/TMCM-343-2.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Blockdiagrams/TMCM-343.svg"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Hardware Manual Rev 1.07", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-343_hardware_manual_hw1.01_rev1.07.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["CANopen Firmware Manual Rev V2.01 for Firmware V3.20", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/CANopen_firmware_manual_TMCM-341_342_343_351_V2.01.pdf"], ["CANopen Firmware Manual Rev V2.0 for Firmware V3.18", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-34x_CANopen_firmware_manual.pdf"], ["TMCL Firmware Manual Rev V1.06 for Firmware V4.36", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-34x_TMCL_firmware_manual.pdf"]], "Software": [["TMCL Firmware V4.49", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-343_V449.hex"], ["TMCL Firmware V4.48", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-343_V448.hex"], ["TMCL Firmware V4.42", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-343_V442.hex"], ["TMCL Firmware V4.41", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-343_V441.hex"], ["TMCL Firmware V4.39", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-343_V439.hex"], ["CANopen Firmware V3.20", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-343-CANopen_V320.hex"], ["CANopen Firmware V3.18 (hex and EDS file)", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-343_CANopen_V318.zip"], ["CANopen Firmware V3.09 (hex and EDS file)", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-343_CANopen_V309.zip"], ["CANopen Firmware V3.05 (hex and EDS file)", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM343_CANopen_V305.zip"], ["CANopen Firmware V3.03 (hex and EDS file)", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM343_CANopen_V303.zip"]], "PCNs": [["PCN-2017-07-04 - Firmware 3.20", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/PCNs/PCN_2017-07-04_Firmware_V320.pdf"]]}}
