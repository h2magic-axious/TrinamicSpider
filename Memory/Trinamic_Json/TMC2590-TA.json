{"model": "TMC2590-TA", "excerpt": "The TMC2590 driver for two-phase stepper motors offers an industry-leading feature set, including high-resolution microstepping, sensorless mechanical load measurement, load-adaptive power optimization, and low-resonance chopper operation. It uses external N- and P-channel MOSFETs for motor currents from 1A up to roughly 8A. The TMC2590 offers\u00a0standard SPI and Step/Dir interfaces to simplify communication as well as stand alone configuration options.\u00a0Special FeaturesMicroPlyer\u2122break before makeCoolStep\u2122short detectionslope controlSpreadCycle\u2122Stall detectionStallGuard2\u2122Current Sense", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "1", "Motor Supply": "5\u202660V", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "SPI": "Yes", "Step/Dir": "Yes", "MicroPlyer\u2122": "Yes", "break before make": "Yes", "CoolStep\u2122": "Yes", "short detection": "Yes", "slope control": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "Stall detection": "Yes", "StallGuard2\u2122": "Yes", "Current Sense": "Yes", "Phase Current, RMS": "4.0A", "Package": "TQFP32-EP (5x5)"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Images/TMC2590-TA.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/user_upload/TMC2590_Block_Diagram.svg", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Pinouts/TMC2590-TA_pinout.JPG"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Datasheet Rev 1.02", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC2590_datasheet_V1.02.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["Calculation Sheet", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC2590_calculations.xls"]], "Additional Resources": [["Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)", "https://trinamic.comhttps://www.trinamic.com/support/faq/"], ["Application Programming Interface (API)", "https://trinamic.comhttps://www.trinamic.com/support/software/access-package/"]]}}
