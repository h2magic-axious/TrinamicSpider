{"model": "TMC2100-TA", "excerpt": "The TMC2100 provides an integrated motor driver solution for 3D-Printing, Cameras, Scanners and other automated equipment applications. The device has an integrated microstepping indexer, the completely noiseless current control mode StealthChop\u2122 and is intended to drive a bipolar stepper motor. The output driver block consists of low RDSon N-Channel power MOSFETs configured as full H-bridges to drive the motor windings. The TMC2100 is capable of driving up to 2.5A of current from each output (with proper heatsinking). TMC2100 is designed for a supply voltage of 5...46V. The device has a step and direction interface and can be configured with digital pins.Special FeaturesMicroPlyer\u2122SpreadCycle\u2122StealthChop\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "1", "Motor Supply": "5\u202646V", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "Step/Dir": "Yes", "MicroPlyer\u2122": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "StealthChop\u2122": "Yes", "Phase Current, RMS": "1.4A", "Package": "eTQFP48 (7x7)"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Images/tmc2100-ta.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Blockdiagrams/TMC2100-V2.svg", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Pinouts/TMC2100-LA.svg"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Datasheet Rev 1.11", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC2100_datasheet_Rev1.11.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["Acceleration and Velocity Calculation Sheet", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC5130_TMC2130_TMC2100_Calculations.xlsx"], ["Calculation Sheet", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC5130_TMC2130_TMC2100_Calculations.xlsx"]], "Quality": [["Statement concerning RoHS compliance of TMC2100", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Company/Quality/RoHS_ICs/TMC2100_RoHS.pdf"]], "Additional Resources": [["Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)", "https://trinamic.comhttps://www.trinamic.com/support/faq/"], ["Application Programming Interface (API)", "https://trinamic.comhttps://www.trinamic.com/support/software/access-package/"]], "Application Notes": [["AN 005i - PCB Footprint Guidelines QFN36 5x6", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/AN005i-IC_Package_PCB_Footprint_Guidelines_QFN36_5x6.pdf"], ["AN 005a - PCB Footprint Guidelines eTQFP48", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/AN005a-IC_Package_PCB_Footprint_Guidelines_eTQFP48.pdf"]]}}
