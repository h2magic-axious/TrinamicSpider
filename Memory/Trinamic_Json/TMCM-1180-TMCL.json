{"model": "TMCM-1180-TMCL", "excerpt": "The TMCM-1180 is a single axis stepper motor controller/driver module for sensorless load dependent current control. The device is powered by Trinamic StallGuard2\u2122, CoolStep\u2122 and SpreadCycle\u2122 chopper technology and has a trapezoidal ramp generator. The TMCM-1180 is capable of driving up to 7.8A of current from each output (with proper heatsinking). It is designed for an operating voltage of 18...55V. The device provides a RS485, CAN, USB, S/D and encoder interface. An integrated protocol processor supplies a high level TMCL/ CANopen communication.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data.More about the TMCL-IDESpecial FeaturesStallGuard2\u2122CoolStep\u2122SpreadCycle\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "1", "Motor Supply": "18\u202655V", "Phase Current, RMS": "5.5A", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "a/b/n incremental": "Yes", "CAN": "Yes", "RS232": "Yes", "RS485": "Yes", "Step/Dir": "Yes", "USB": "Yes", "SensOstep\u2122": "Yes", "CANopen": "", "TMCL\u2122": "Yes", "trapezoidal": "Yes", "StallGuard2\u2122": "Yes", "CoolStep\u2122": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "Width": "86mm", "Length": "86mm", "Height": "22mm"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Images/TMCM-1180.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Blockdiagrams/TMCM-1180_Block_Diagram.svg"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Hardware Manual Rev 1.05", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1180_hardware_manual_hw1.10_rev1.05.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["TMCL Firmware Manual FW V4.48 Rev 1.13", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1180-TMCL_firmware_manual_fw4.48_rev1.14.pdf"], ["TMCL Firmware Manual FW V4.48 Rev 1.12", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1180_TMCL_firmware_manual_Fw4.48_Rev1.12.pdf"], ["TMCL Firmware Manual FW V4.45 Rev 1.10", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1180_TMCL_firmware_manual.pdf"], ["CANopen Firmware Manual FW V3.20 Rev 2.11", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1180-CANopen_firmware_manual_fw3.20_rev2.11.pdf"], ["CANopen Firmware Manual FW V3.16 Rev 2.00", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1180_CANopen_firmware_manual.pdf"]], "Software": [["Setup Information (Trinamic_inf_cat)", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Software/Trinamic_inf_cat.zip"], ["CANopen Firmware V3.20 (hex and EDS file)", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1180_CANopen_V320.zip"], ["CANopen Firmware V3.18 (hex and EDS file)", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1180_CANopen_V318.zip"], ["CANopen Firmware V3.16 (hex and EDS file)", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1180_CANopen_V316.zip"], ["CANopen Firmware V3.09 (hex and EDS file)", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1180_CANopen_V309.zip"], ["TMCL Firmware V4.48", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1180_V448.hex"], ["TMCL Firmware V4.45", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1180_V445.hex"], ["TMCL Firmware V4.42", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1180_V442.hex"], ["TMCL Firmware V4.41", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1180_V441.hex"]], "Drawings": [["STEP-File V1.1", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Drawings/TMCM-1180_V11.stp"]], "PCNs": [["PCN-2017-07-04 - Firmware 3.20", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/PCNs/PCN_2017-07-04_Firmware_V320.pdf"], ["PCN TMCM-1180", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/EOL_PCN/PCN_2016-01-06_TMCM-1180.pdf"]]}}
