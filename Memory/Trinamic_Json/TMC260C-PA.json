{"model": "TMC260C-PA", "excerpt": "The TMC260 provides an integrated motor driver solution for Laboratory Automation, 3D-Printing, Scanners and other automated equipment applications. The device has an integrated microstepping indexer, the sensorless stall detection technology StallGuard2\u2122 and the sensorless load dependent current control CoolStep\u2122 and is intended to drive a bipolar stepper motor. The output driver block consists of low RDSon TrenchFET power MOSFETs configured as full H-bridges to drive the motor windings. The TMC260 is capable of driving up to 2A of current from each output (with proper heatsinking). TMC260 is designed for a supply voltage of 9...40V. The device has a SPI interface for configuration and diagnostics and a step and direction interface.Special FeaturesStallGuard2\u2122CoolStep\u2122SpreadCycle\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "Active", "Axes": "1", "Motor Supply": "9\u202640V", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "SPI": "Yes", "Step/Dir": "Yes", "StallGuard2\u2122": "Yes", "CoolStep\u2122": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "Phase Current, RMS": "1.4A", "Package": "LQFP44 (10x10)"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Images/tmc260c-pa.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Blockdiagrams/TMC260-V2.svg", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Pinouts/TMC260.svg"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["TMC260C Datasheet Rev 1.01", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC260C_Datasheet_Rev1.01.pdf"], ["TMC260(A) Datasheet Rev 2.12", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC260_datasheet_Rev2.12.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["Getting Started", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC260_and_TMC261_Getting_started.pdf"], ["Power Dissipation Calculation", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/tmc262_calculations.xls"]], "Application Notes": [["AN 005d - PCB Footprint Guidelines LQFP44", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/AN005d-IC_Package_PCB_Footprint_Guidelines_LQFP44.pdf"], ["AN 016 - TMC429 TMC26x Getting Started: Motion Control via S/D", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Appnotes/AN016_TMC429_TMC26x_Getting_Started_01.pdf"], ["AN 040 - Understanding EMC TMC260, TMC261, TMC2660", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Appnotes/AN040-Understanding_EMC_TMC260_TMC261_TMC2660.pdf"], ["AN 044 - Replacing the TMC236/TMC246 by the TMC260 or TMC261", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Appnotes/AN044-Replacing_the_TMC236_or_TMC246_by_the_TMC260_or_TMC261_in_an_existing_project.pdf"]], "Quality": [["Statement concerning RoHS compliance of TMC260", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Company/Quality/RoHS_ICs/TMC260_RoHS.pdf"]], "PCNs": [["PCN 2020-07-01 TMC260C-PA", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/EOL_PCN/PCN_2020-07-01_TMC260C.pdf"], ["PCN 2016-06-04 TMC260A-PA", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/EOL_PCN/PCN_2016-06-04_TMC260-PA.pdf"]], "Additional Resources": [["Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)", "https://trinamic.comhttps://www.trinamic.com/support/faq/"], ["Application Programming Interface (API)", "https://trinamic.comhttps://www.trinamic.com/support/software/access-package/"]]}}
