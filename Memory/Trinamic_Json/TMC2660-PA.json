{"model": "TMC2660-PA", "excerpt": "The TMC2660 provides an integrated motor driver solution for Laboratory Automation, 3D-Printing, Scanners and other automated equipment applications. The device has an integrated microstepping indexer, the sensorless stall detection technology StallGuard2\u2122 and the sensorless load dependent current control CoolStep\u2122 and is intended to drive a bipolar stepper motor. The output driver block consists of low RDSon TrenchFET power MOSFETs configured as full H-bridges to drive the motor windings. The TMC2660 is capable of driving up to 4A of current from each output (with proper heatsinking). TMC2660 is designed for a supply voltage of 9...30V. The device has a SPI interface for configuration and diagnostics and a step and direction interface.Special FeaturesStallGuard2\u2122CoolStep\u2122SpreadCycle\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "1", "Motor Supply": "9\u202630V", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "SPI": "Yes", "Step/Dir": "Yes", "StallGuard2\u2122": "Yes", "CoolStep\u2122": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "Phase Current, RMS": "2.8A", "Package": "LQFP44 (10x10)"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Images/tmc2660.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Blockdiagrams/TMC2660-V2.svg", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Pinouts/TMC2660.svg"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["TMC2660 Datasheet", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC2660_datasheet_Rev1.07.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["Getting started", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC26x_Getting_started.pdf"], ["Power dissipation calculation", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/tmc2660_calculations.xls"], ["Rsense and current calculation", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC26x_Rsense_Calculation.xlsx"]], "Software": [["TMC26x Configurator", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Software/TMC26X_CONFIG.exe"]], "Application Notes": [["Application Note 040 - Understanding EMC TMC260, TMC261, TMC2660", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Appnotes/AN040-Understanding_EMC_TMC260_TMC261_TMC2660.pdf"], ["Application Note 005d - LQFP44", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/AN005d-IC_Package_PCB_Footprint_Guidelines_LQFP44.pdf"]], "Quality": [["Statement concerning RoHS compliance of TMC2660", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Company/Quality/RoHS_ICs/TMC2660_RoHS.pdf"]]}}
