{"model": "TMCM-1076", "excerpt": "The TMCM-1076 is an easy to use stepper motor driver unit with state of the art feature set. It is highly integrated and offers a convenient handling.The module is controlled via a step and direction interface. One configuration pin selects the current control mode between StealthChop\u2122 for absolute silent motor control and SpreadCycle\u2122 for high speed. A TTL UART interface allows for more advanced configuration and permanent parameter storage via TMCL\u2122- IDE.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data.More about the TMCL-IDESpecial FeaturesMicroPlyer\u2122CoolStep\u2122SpreadCycle\u2122StallGuard2\u2122StealthChop\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "1", "Motor Supply": "10\u202630V", "Phase Current, RMS": "3.0A", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "Step/Dir": "Yes", "UART": "Yes", "TMCL\u2122": "Yes", "MicroPlyer\u2122": "Yes", "CoolStep\u2122": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "StallGuard2\u2122": "Yes", "StealthChop\u2122": "Yes", "Width": "60mm", "Length": "60mm", "Height": "13mm"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Images/TMCM-1076.jpg", "images": null, "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Hardware Manual Rev 1.01", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1076_hardware_manual_hw1.10_rev1.01.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["TMCL Firmware Manual FW V1.02 Rev 1.03", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1076-TMCL_firmware_manual_fw1.02_rev1.03.pdf"]], "Software": [["TMCL Firmware V1.02", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1076_V102.hex"]]}}
