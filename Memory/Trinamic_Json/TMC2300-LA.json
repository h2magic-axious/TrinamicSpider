{"model": "TMC2300-LA", "excerpt": "The TMC2300 low voltage stepper motor driver is intended for battery-operated, space and standby-power critical driver applications. Its silent drive technology StealthChop\u2122 enables non-bugging motion control for portable, home and office applications. A highly efficient power stage, boosted by an internal charge pump for best in-class RDSon resistance, provides high motor current from a tiny package even at low supply voltages. With this, dual AA batteries can be drained down to typically 2.0V (voltage must not drop below 1.8V, provide sufficient supply buffer capacitors).Special FeaturesMicroPlyer\u2122CoolStep\u2122StealthChop2\u2122StallGuard4\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "1", "Motor Supply": "2\u202611V", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "Step/Dir": "Yes", "UART": "Yes", "MicroPlyer\u2122": "Yes", "CoolStep\u2122": "Yes", "StealthChop2\u2122": "Yes", "StallGuard4\u2122": "Yes", "Phase Current, RMS": "1.2A", "Package": "QFN20 (3x3)"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Images/TMC2300-LA.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Blockdiagrams/TMC2300_Block_Diagramm.svg", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Pinouts/TMC2300.svg"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Datasheet Rev 1.04", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC2300_Datasheet_V104.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["Calculation Sheet", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC2300_Calculations.xlsx"]], "Quality": [["Statement concerning RoHS compliance of TMC2300", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Company/Quality/RoHS_ICs/TMC2300_ROHS.pdf"]], "Additional Resources": [["Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)", "https://trinamic.comhttps://www.trinamic.com/support/faq/"], ["Application Programming Interface (API)", "https://trinamic.comhttps://www.trinamic.com/support/software/access-package/"]]}}
