{"model": "TMC6200-TA", "excerpt": "The TMC6200 is a high-power gate driver for PMSM servo or BLDC motors.Using six external MOSFETs and two or three sense resistors, it integrates the full high voltage part of a FOC drive system for 12V, 24V or 48V, including in-line current sense amplifiers with programmable amplification.It can drive a wide range of motors from Watt to Kilowatt. Software controlled drive strength allows in-system EME optimization. Programmable safety features like short detection and overtemperature thresholds together with an SPI interface for diagnostics allow robust and reliable designs. With the TMC6200, a minimum number of external components is required to build a rugged drive with full protection and diagnostics.Special Featuresbreak before make", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "1", "Motor Supply": "8\u202660V", "Microsteps": "", "PWM": "Yes", "SPI": "Yes", "break before make": "Yes", "Phase Current, RMS": "", "Package": "eTQFP48 (7x7)"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Images/TMC6200-TA.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Blockdiagrams/TMC6200-TA-V2.svg", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Pinouts/TMC6200-TA.png"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Datasheet Rev 1.06", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC6200_datasheet_Rev1.06.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["Calculation Sheet", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC6200_Calculations.xlsx"]], "Drawings": [["TMC6200 - PADS Files", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC6200-TA.zip"]], "Quality": [["Statement concerning RoHS compliance of TMC6200", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Company/Quality/RoHS_ICs/TMC6200_RoHS.pdf"]], "Application Notes": [["AN 005a - PCB Footprint Guidelines eTQFP48", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/AN005a-IC_Package_PCB_Footprint_Guidelines_eTQFP48.pdf"]]}}
