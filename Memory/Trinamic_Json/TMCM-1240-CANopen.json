{"model": "TMCM-1240-CANopen", "excerpt": "TMCM-1240 is a single axis motor controller/driver board for 2-phase bipolar stepper motors. It supports SixPoint\u2122 ramps in addition to linear ramps. TMCM-1240 is capable of driving up to 2A RMS motor current and is designed for an operating voltage of 10...30V DC supply voltage. The device provides a Step/Dir interface, an integrated SensOstep\u2122 encoder and support for external encoder.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data.More about the TMCL-IDESpecial FeaturesDcStep\u2122CoolStep\u2122SpreadCycle\u2122StallGuard2\u2122StealthChop\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "1", "Motor Supply": "10\u202630V", "Phase Current, RMS": "2.0A", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "a/b/n incremental": "Yes", "CAN": "Yes", "RS485": "Yes", "Step/Dir": "Yes", "USB": "Yes", "GPIO": "Yes", "SensOstep\u2122": "Yes", "TMCL\u2122": "", "CANopen": "Yes", "SixPoint\u2122": "Yes", "DcStep\u2122": "Yes", "CoolStep\u2122": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "StallGuard2\u2122": "Yes", "StealthChop\u2122": "Yes", "Width": "37mm", "Length": "37mm", "Height": "11mm"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Images/TMCM-1240.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Blockdiagrams/TMCM-1240_Blockdiagramm_v2.svg"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Hardware Manual Rev 1.21", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1240_hardware_manual_hw1.20_rev1.21.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["TMCL Firmware Manual FW V1.45 Rev 1.02", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1240_TMCL_firmware_manual_Fw1.45_Rev1.02.pdf"], ["TMCL Firmware Manual FW V1.43 Rev 1.00", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1240_TMCL_firmware_manual.pdf"], ["CANopen Firmware Manual FW V3.22 Rev 1.01", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1240_CANopen_firmware_manual_Fw3.22_Rev1.01.pdf"], ["CANopen Firmware Manual FW V3.21 Rev 1.00", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1240_CANopen_firmware_manual.pdf"]], "Software": [["TMCL Firmware V1.45", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1240_TMCL_V145.hex"], ["TMCL Firmware V1.43", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1240_TMCL_V143.hex"], ["CANopen Firmware V3.22 (hex and EDS file)", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1240_CANopen_V322.zip"], ["CANopen Firmware V3.21 (hex and EDS file)", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1240_CANopen_V321.zip"], ["Setup Information (Trinamic_inf_cat)", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Software/Trinamic_inf_cat.zip"]], "Drawings": [["Step-File for V1.1 and V1.2", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Drawings/TMCM-1240_V11.step"]], "PCNs": [["PCN 2018-12-01 TMCM-1240", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/PCN_2018-12-01_TMCM-1240.pdf"]]}}
