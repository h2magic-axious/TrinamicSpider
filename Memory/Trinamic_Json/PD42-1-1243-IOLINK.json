{"model": "PD42-1-1243-IOLINK", "excerpt": "The PD42-1-1243 is a small easy-to-use mechatronic PANdrive\u2122 IO-Link\u2122 actuator device. It combines a NEMA-17 stepper motor with controller and driver electronics. The IO-Link connection through standard 4-pin M12 connector offers full control over the NEMA-17 stepper motor as well as provide a industry-standard IO Link communication protocol enabling control, configuration, and status monitoring.The new chipset solution of TMC2130-LA and MAX22513\u00a0builds upon the benefits of IO-Link\u2019s two-way universal interface. The intelligent actuator, which combines industry-leading motion control technology into a plug-and-play solution, is 2.6x smaller and more than 50\u00a0percent lower power compared to the competitive solution. It brings intelligence to the factory floor by providing 50 percent more parameters to help improve predicting factory shutdown in advance and maximizes factory throughput.Pair\u00a0the intelligent actuator with\u00a0the MAXREFDES165# four-channel IO-Link master reference design for a complete IO-Link solution.Special FeaturesCoolStep\u2122SpreadCycle\u2122StallGuard2\u2122StealthChop\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Flange NEMA": "17", "Flange": "42mm", "Holding Torque": "27Ncm", "Motor Supply": "6\u202628V", "Rated Speed": "", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "IO-Link\u2122": "Yes", "CoolStep\u2122": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "StallGuard2\u2122": "Yes", "StealthChop\u2122": "Yes", "Width": "42mm", "Height": "42mm", "Length": "60mm"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Images/PD42-1-1243.jpg", "images": null, "resource": {"Datasheet": [["PD-1243 Hardware Manual", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Documents/PD42-x-1243_HW_Manual_V10.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["IO-Link Firmware Manual Rev V1.01 for Firmware V1.00", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Documents/PD42-x-1243_FW_Manual_V11.pdf"]], "Software": [["IODD File", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Software/PD42-x-1243_IODD.zip"]], "Drawings": [["PD42-1-1243-IOLINK STEP File", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Drawings/PD42-1-1243-IOLINK.STEP"]]}}
