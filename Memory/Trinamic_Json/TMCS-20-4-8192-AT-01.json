{"model": "TMCS-20-4-8192-AT-01", "excerpt": "With their exceptional low speed performance stepper motors are often a good choice where a servo is required but a gearbox for some reason is not beneficial. With their high pole count stepper motors servos work better with high resolution encoders.TMCS-20 is a low-cost and small-size optical incremental encoder optimized for small stepper motors. It comes with high resolution optical code wheels with a resolution of up to 8K lines.", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Resolution": "32768 increments", "Hollow Diameter": "4mm", "Housing Diameter": "20mm", "Level": "TTL", "a/b/n incremental": "Yes"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Encoder_Images/TMCS-20.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Encoder_Images/TMCS-BD.png"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["TMCS-20 Datasheet Rev1.30", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Encoder_Documents/TMCS-20_datasheet_Rev1.40.pdf"]], "Drawings": [["TMCS-20 3D File", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Drawings/TMCS-20_V2.step"]], "Application Notes": [["Application Note 050 - TMCS-XX Encoder Mounting Manual", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Appnotes/AN050_-_TMCS-XX_Mounting_Manual.pdf"]]}}
