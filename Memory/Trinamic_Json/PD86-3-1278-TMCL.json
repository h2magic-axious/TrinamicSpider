{"model": "PD86-3-1278-TMCL", "excerpt": "PD60/86-1278 is a full-mechatronic solution combining of easy-to-use, high-power motion controller/ driver module and PANdrive\u2122 smart stepper motor.The driver module is conveniently mounted on the NEMA24/34 size PANdrive\u2122 motor. This driver module is controlled via a CAN bus interface and comes with two firmware options \u2013 TMCL and CANopen. PD60/86-1278 features StealthChop\u2122 for absolute silent motor control, SpreadCycle\u2122 for high speed stepper motor commutation, a fully integrated hardware motion controller with SixPoint\u2122 motion ramps, as well as StallGuard2\u2122 and CoolStep\u2122.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data.More about the TMCL-IDESpecial FeaturesCoolStep\u2122SpreadCycle\u2122StallGuard2\u2122StealthChop\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Flange NEMA": "34", "Flange": "86mm", "Holding Torque": "700Ncm", "Motor Supply": "12\u202648V", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "a/b/n incremental": "Yes", "CAN": "Yes", "TMCL\u2122": "Yes", "CANopen": "", "SixPoint\u2122": "Yes", "CoolStep\u2122": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "StallGuard2\u2122": "Yes", "StealthChop\u2122": "Yes", "Width": "86mm", "Height": "86mm", "Length": "124mm"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Images/PD86-3-1278_TMCL.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Blockdiagrams/PDxx-1278_block_diagram_01.svg"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Hardware Manual Rev 1.22", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Documents/PD-1278_hardware_manual_hw1.10_rev1.22.pdf"]], "Drawings": [["PD60-4H-1278 STEP File", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Drawings/PD60-4H-1278.STEP"], ["PD86-3-1278 STEP File", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Drawings/PD86-3-1278.STEP"]], "Documentation": [["TMCL Firmware Manual FW V1.15 Rev 1.04", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Documents/PD-1278-TMCL_firmware_manual_fw1.15_rev1.04.pdf"], ["CANopen Firmware Manual FW V3.23 Rev 1.01", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Documents/PD-1278-CANopen_firmware_manual_fw3.23_rev1.01.pdf"]], "Software": [["TMCL Firmware V1.15", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Software/TMCM-1278_TMCL_V115.hex"], ["CANopen Firmware V3.23 (hex and EDS file)", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Software/TMCM-1278_CANopen_V323.zip"]]}}
