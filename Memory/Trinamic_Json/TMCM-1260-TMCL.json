{"model": "TMCM-1260-TMCL", "excerpt": "The TMCM-1260 is a single axis motor controller/driver board for 2-phase bipolar stepper motors with up-to 6A RMS motor current and 48V DC supply. It supports SixPoint\u2122 ramps in addition to linear ramps.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data.More about the TMCL-IDESpecial FeaturesCoolStep\u2122SpreadCycle\u2122StealthChop\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "1", "Motor Supply": "12\u202654V", "Phase Current, RMS": "6.0A", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "a/b/n incremental": "Yes", "CAN": "Yes", "RS485": "Yes", "Step/Dir": "Yes", "USB": "Yes", "SensOstep\u2122": "Yes", "TMCL\u2122": "Yes", "CANopen": "", "SixPoint\u2122": "Yes", "CoolStep\u2122": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "StealthChop\u2122": "Yes", "Width": "60mm", "Length": "60mm", "Height": "26mm"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Images/TMCM-1260.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Blockdiagrams/TMCM-1260_Blockdiagramm.svg"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Hardware Manual Rev 1.20", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1260_hardware_manual_hw1.10_rev1.30.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["TMCL Firmware Manual for Firmware V1.44 Rev V1.02", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1260_TMCL_firmware_manual_Fw1.44_Rev1.02.pdf"], ["CANopen Firmware Manual for Firmware V3.21 Rev V1.00", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1260_CANopen_firmware_manual_Fw3.21_Rev1.00.pdf"]], "Software": [["TMCL Firmware V1.44", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1260_TMCL_V144.hex"], ["CANopen Firmware V3.21 (hex and EDS file)", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1260_CANopen_V321.zip"]], "Drawings": [["TMCM-1260 Step-File V1.1", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Drawings/TMCM-1260_V11.step"]]}}
