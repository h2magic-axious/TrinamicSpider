{"model": "TMC2130-TA", "excerpt": "The TMC2130 provides an integrated motor driver solution for 3D-Printing, Cameras, Scanners and other automated equipment applications. The device has an integrated microstepping indexer, the sensorless stall detection technology StallGuard2\u2122, the sensorless load dependent current control CoolStep\u2122 and the completely noiseless current control mode StealthChop\u2122 and is intended to drive a bipolar stepper motor. The output driver block consists of low RDSon N-Channel power MOSFETs configured as full H-bridges to drive the motor windings. The TMC2130 is capable of driving up to 2.5A of current from each output (with proper heatsinking). TMC2130 is designed for a supply voltage of 5...46V. The device has a SPI interface for configuration and diagnostics and a step and direction interface.Special Featuresmicrostep tableMicroPlyer\u2122CoolStep\u2122passive brakingshort detectionSpreadCycle\u2122Stall detectionStallGuard2\u2122StealthChop\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "1", "Motor Supply": "4.75\u202646V", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "SPI": "Yes", "Step/Dir": "Yes", "microstep table": "Yes", "MicroPlyer\u2122": "Yes", "CoolStep\u2122": "Yes", "passive braking": "Yes", "short detection": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "Stall detection": "Yes", "StallGuard2\u2122": "Yes", "StealthChop\u2122": "Yes", "Phase Current, RMS": "1.4A", "Package": "eTQFP48 (7x7)"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Images/TMC2130-TA.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Blockdiagrams/TMC2130-V2.svg", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Pinouts/TMC2130-LA.svg", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Pinouts/TMC2130-TA.svg"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Datasheet Rev 1.12", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC2130_datasheet_Rev1.12.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["Calculation Sheet", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC5130_TMC2130_TMC2100_Calculations.xlsx"]], "Quality": [["Statement concerning RoHS compliance of TMC2130", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Company/Quality/RoHS_ICs/TMC2130_RoHS.pdf"]], "Additional Resources": [["Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)", "https://trinamic.comhttps://www.trinamic.com/support/faq/"], ["Application Programming Interface (API)", "https://trinamic.comhttps://www.trinamic.com/support/software/access-package/"]], "Application Notes": [["AN 005i - PCB Footprint Guidelines QFN36 5x6", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/AN005i-IC_Package_PCB_Footprint_Guidelines_QFN36_5x6.pdf"], ["AN 005a - PCB Footprint Guidelines eTQFP48", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/AN005a-IC_Package_PCB_Footprint_Guidelines_eTQFP48.pdf"]]}}
