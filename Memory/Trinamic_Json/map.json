    "excerpt": "The baseboard BB-163x allows to build a ready to use BLDC motor driver unit using the TMCM-1630 driver module or the TMCM-1633 driver module. It integrates velocity and torque (via current) control as well as a hall sensor based positioning mode. The position resolution depends on the motor, i.e. a standard 8 pole motor gives a motor axis resolution of 15 degrees.The module can be used in stand alone operation or it can be remotely controlled via RS232, CAN, RS485 or USB (depending on the used module). All important signals and the power supply lines can be connected easily. For motor, power supply and hall sensors screw terminals are available and for the host interface dedicated connectors. The baseboard has two potentiometers to adjust torque and velocity. An incremental encoder can be attached at an 10-pin header connector.",

It is highly integrated and offers a convenient handling.The PD57/60-x-1076 includes a stepper motor and driver electronics. The module is controlled via a step and direction interface. One configuration pin selects the current control mode between StealthChop\u2122 for absolute silent motor control and SpreadCycle\u2122 for high speed. A TTL UART interface allows for more advanced configuration, for example of the StallGuard2\u2122 and CoolStep\u2122 features, and permanent parameter storage via TMCL\u2122-IDE.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE.

The drive is controlled via a CAN bus interface and comes with two firmware options \u2013 TMCL\u2122 and CANopen\u00ae.With its built-in high resolution encoder, the PD57/60/86-1378 is mainly designed for closed-loop operation, but also features StealthChop\u2122 for absolute silent motor control, SpreadCycle\u2122 for high speed stepper motor commutation as well as StallGuard2\u2122 and CoolStep\u2122. The fully integrated hardware motion controller supports trapezoidal ramps, SixPoint\u2122 ramps and s-shaped ramps.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data.More about the TMCL-IDESpecial Featuresclosed loop controlCoolStep\u2122SpreadCycle\u2122StallGuard2\u2122StealthChop\u2122",

To simplify the transfer to your own processor platform the MCU board can be disconnected. For use with an encoder, please connect VIO to encoder supply, as visualized in\u00a0the schematics.As the TMC4361A-EVAL uses the SPI interface of the Eselsbr\u00fccke and Landungsbr\u00fccke, it's best to combine this motion controller with one of the driver evaluation boards like the TMC23x, TMC24x, TMC26x, or TMC21x0-EVAL for quick testing and setup.\u00a0All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data.

In addition we recommend to use the USB adapter for real-time-monitoring interface (RTMI): USB-2-RTMI.The complete set allows for a quick and simple start within only minutes to make your motor turning, while still providing full access to all registers and full functionality and diagnostics. For diagnosis, all signals between MCU and TMC4671 are accessible with probes on the Eselsbr\u00fccke bridge board. To simplify the transfer to your own processor platform the MCU board can be disconnected.\u00a0All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data. All settings can simply be exported for your own firmware project.More about the TMCL-IDEIf you like to see a step by step guide on driving a linear stage with the TMC4671, please visit the blog post where one of Trinamic's Engineers explains in 3 posts how to set up your linear stage, how to tune the controller using the TMCL-IDE, and how to adapt the firmware to your own project.Quick Setup GuideSpecial Featuresclosed loop controlFOCposition modevelocity modedual encoder",

It allows for a quick and simple start within only minutes to make your motor turning, while still providing full access to all registers and full functionality and diagnostics.For diagnosis, all signals between MCU and TMC5160 are accessible with probes on the Eselsbr\u00fccke bridge board. To simplify the transfer to your own processor platform the MCU board can be disconnected.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data. All settings can simply be exported for your own firmware project.More about the TMCL-IDESpecial FeaturesMicroPlyer\u2122CoolStep\u2122passive brakingshort detectionSpreadCycle\u2122Stall detectionStallGuard2\u2122StealthChop2\u2122",

The built in encoder feedback makes it an optimum solution for high-reliability drives. This drive is optimally suited for industrial high-reliability applications. The power stage has very low dissipation when compared to competitors' products. Its interface add-on board concept allows for customer specific interface / connector selection. The TMCM-102 comes with the PC based software development environment TMCL-IDE for the Trinamic Motion Control Language (TMCL\u2122). Using predefined TMCL\u2122 high level commands like \"move to position\" or \"constant rotation\" rapid and fast development of motion control applications is guaranteed. Communication traffic is kept very low since all time critical operations, e.g. ramp calculation, are performed on board. The TMCL program can be stored in the on-board EEPROM for stand-alone operation. The firmware of the module can be updated via the serial interface. With the StallGuard\u2122 feature it is possible to detect motor overload or motor stall.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data.More about the TMCL-IDESpecial FeaturesStallGuard\u2122",

As an alternative, an optical encoder can be connected via digital ABN inputs. Different ramp shapes can be selected. Dynamic current control, and quiet, smooth and efficient operation are combined with StallGuard\u2122 and CoolStep\u2122 features.Special Featuresclosed loop controlDcStep\u2122ChopSync\u2122CoolStep\u2122SpreadCycle\u2122StallGuard2\u2122StealthChop\u2122",

The device is powered by Trinamic StallGuard2\u2122, CoolStep\u2122, SpreadCycle\u2122, StealthChop\u2122 and DcStep\u2122 technology and has a SixPoint\u2122 ramp generator. The TMCM-6213 is capable of driving up to 1.5A peak of current from each output (with proper heatsinking). It is designed for an operating voltage of 11...35V. The device provides a USB, EtherCAT and 6 encoder interfaces. An integrated protocol processor supplies a high level CANopen over EtherCAT communication.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data.More about the TMCL-IDESpecial FeaturesDcStep\u2122MicroPlyer\u2122CoolStep\u2122SpreadCycle\u2122StallGuard2\u2122StealthChop\u2122",
