{"model": "TMC2208-EVAL", "excerpt": "The TMC2208-EVAL allows you to explore all functions of the TMC2208-LA.The TMC2208-EVAL-KIT is a set of one MCU board Landungsbr\u00fccke, a TMC22xx bridge board and one TMC2208-EVAL driver board. It allows for a quick and simple start within only minutes to make your motor turning, while still providing full access to all registers and full functionality and diagnostics.For diagnosis, all signals between MCU and TMC2208 are accessible with probes on the bridge board. TMC2208-EVAL can be used with or without the Landungsbr\u00fccke\u00a0MCU board. Compehensive sample code can be found in Trinamics Technology Access Package TTAP.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data. All settings can simply be exported for your own firmware project.More about the TMCL-IDESpecial FeaturesMicroPlyer\u2122SpreadCycle\u2122StealthChop2\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Motor Supply": "4.75\u202636V", "Phase Current, RMS": "1.35A", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "Step/Dir": "Yes", "UART": "Yes", "MicroPlyer\u2122": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "StealthChop2\u2122": "Yes"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Images/TMC2208-Eval.jpg", "images": null, "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Datasheet Rev 1.10", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC220x_TMC2224_Datasheet_Rev1.10.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["User Manual Rev 1.00", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Documents/TMC2208-EVAL_user_manual_rev1.00.pdf"]], "Drawings": [["TMC2208-EVAL EAGLE Files V1.1", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Drawings/TMC2208-Eval_v11_EAGLE_files.ZIP"], ["TMC2208-EVAL GERBER Files V1.1", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Drawings/TMC2208-EVAL_GERBER_Files.zip"], ["TMC2208-EVAL Layout Data (PDF) V1.1", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Drawings/TMC2208-EVAL-Layout_Data_V1.1.zip"], ["TMC22xx-Bridge EAGLE Files V1.1", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Drawings/TMC2208-Bridge_v11_EAGLE_files.ZIP"], ["TMC22xx-Bridge Schematic V1.1", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Drawings/TMC22xx-Bridge_v11_01_Schematic.pdf"]]}}
