{"model": "TMC4671-ES", "excerpt": "The TMC4671 is a fully integrated servo controller, providing Field Oriented Control (FOC) for BLDC/PMSM and 2-phase stepper motors as well as DC motors and voice coils. All control functions are implemented in hardware. Integrated ADCs, position sensor interfaces, position interpolators, enable a fully functional servo controller for a wide range of servo applications.Special Featuresclosed loop controlFOCposition modevelocity modedual encoder", "fields": {"Status": "Nrnd", "Axes": "1", "a/b/n incremental": "Yes", "Analog Hall": "Yes", "PWM": "Yes", "SPI": "Yes", "UART": "Yes", "GPIO": "Yes", "Step/Dir": "", "closed loop control": "Yes", "FOC": "Yes", "position mode": "Yes", "velocity mode": "Yes", "dual encoder": "Yes", "Package": "QFN76 (10.5x6.5)"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Images/TMC4671-ES.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Blockdiagrams/TMC4671_Block_Diagram.svg", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Pinouts/TMC4671_Pinning.svg"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["TMC4671-LA Datasheet", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC4671_datasheetv2.01.pdf"], ["TMC4671-ES Datasheet", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC4671_datasheet_v1.06.pdf"]], "PCNs": [["PCN 2020-04-20 TMC4671-ES to TMC4671-LA", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/EOL_PCN/PCN_2020-04-20_TMC4671.pdf"]], "Application Notes": [["Application Note 025 - DC Motor Control with TMC4671", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Appnotes/AN025-DC_Motor_Control_with_TMC4671.pdf"], ["Application Note 053 - TMC4671 PI Tuning", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Appnotes/AN053_TMC4671-PI_Tuning.pdf"], ["Application Note 053 - TMC4671 PI Tuning (Chinese Version)", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Appnotes/AN053_-_TMC4671-PI_Tuning_CN.pdf"]], "Quality": [["Statement concerning RoHS compliance of TMC4671", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Company/Quality/RoHS_ICs/TMC4671_RoHS.pdf"]]}}
