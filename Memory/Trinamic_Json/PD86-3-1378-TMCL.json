{"model": "PD86-3-1378-TMCL", "excerpt": "The PD57/60/86-1378 is an easy to use PANdrive\u2122 smart stepper drive. The drive is controlled via a CAN bus interface and comes with two firmware options \u2013 TMCL\u2122 and CANopen\u00ae.With its built-in high resolution encoder, the PD57/60/86-1378 is mainly designed for closed-loop operation, but also features StealthChop\u2122 for absolute silent motor control, SpreadCycle\u2122 for high speed stepper motor commutation as well as StallGuard2\u2122 and CoolStep\u2122. The fully integrated hardware motion controller supports trapezoidal ramps, SixPoint\u2122 ramps and s-shaped ramps.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data.More about the TMCL-IDESpecial Featuresclosed loop controlCoolStep\u2122SpreadCycle\u2122StallGuard2\u2122StealthChop\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Flange NEMA": "34", "Flange": "86mm", "Holding Torque": "700Ncm", "Motor Supply": "12\u202652V", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "CAN": "Yes", "TMCL\u2122": "Yes", "CANopen": "", "closed loop control": "Yes", "S-shaped": "Yes", "SixPoint\u2122": "Yes", "trapezoidal": "Yes", "CoolStep\u2122": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "StallGuard2\u2122": "Yes", "StealthChop\u2122": "Yes", "Width": "86mm", "Height": "86mm", "Length": "120mm"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Images/PD86-3-1378_TMCL.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Blockdiagrams/PDxx-1378_block_diagram_01.svg"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Hardware Manual Rev 1.21", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Documents/PD-1378_hardware_manual_hw1.10_rev1.21.pdf"]], "Drawings": [["PD57-1-1378 STEP File", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Drawings/PD57-1-1378.STEP"], ["PD57-2-1378 STEP File", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Drawings/PD57-2-1378.STEP"], ["PD60-3-1378 STEP File", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Drawings/PD60-3-1378.STEP"], ["PD60-4-1378 STEP File", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Drawings/PD60-4-1378.STEP"], ["PD60-4H-1378 STEP File", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Drawings/PD60-4H-1378.STEP"], ["PD86-3-1378 STEP File", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Drawings/PD86-3-1378.STEP"]], "Documentation": [["TMCL Firmware Manual FW V1.38 Rev 1.03", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Documents/PD-1378-TMCL_firmware_manual_fw1.38_rev1.03.pdf"], ["CANopen Firmware Manual FW V3.23 Rev 1.01", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Documents/PD-1378-CANopen_firmware_manual_fw3.23_rev1.01.pdf"]], "Software": [["TMCL Firmware V1.38", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Software/TMCM-1378_TMCL_V138.hex"], ["CANopen Firmware V3.23 (hex and EDS file)", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Software/TMCM-1378_CANopen_V323.zip"]]}}
