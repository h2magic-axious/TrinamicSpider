{"model": "TMC6200-EVAL", "excerpt": "The TMC6200-EVAL allows you to explore all functions of the\u00a0TMC6200-TA.The TMC6200-EVAL-KIT is a set of one MCU board\u00a0Landungsbr\u00fccke, two Eselsbr\u00fccke\u00a0bridge boards, one TMC4671-EVAL\u00a0motion controller board as well as one TMC6200-EVAL driver board.It allows for a quick and simple start within only minutes to make your motor turning, while still providing full access to all registers and full functionality and diagnostics.For diagnosis, all signals between MCU and TMC6200\u00a0are accessible with probes on the bridge board. TMC6200-EVAL can be used with or without the Landungsbr\u00fccke\u00a0MCU board. Compehensive sample code can be found in Trinamics Technology Access Package\u00a0TTAP.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data. All settings can simply be exported for your own firmware project.More about the TMCL-IDESpecial Featuresbreak before make", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Motor Supply": "8\u202648V", "Phase Current, RMS": "", "Microsteps": "", "PWM": "Yes", "SPI": "Yes", "break before make": "Yes"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Images/TMC6200-EVAL_1.2.jpg", "images": null, "resource": {"Datasheet": [["TMC6200 Datasheet", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC6200_datasheet_Rev1.06.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["User Manual Rev 1.00", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Documents/TMC6200-EVAL_user_manual_rev1.00.pdf"], ["TMC6200-EVAL BOM V1.2", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Documents/TMC6200-EVAL_V12_-_BOM.xlsx"]], "Drawings": [["PADS Files V1.2", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Drawings/CAD_TMC6200-EVAL_V12.ZIP"], ["Fabrication Data V1.2", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Documents/TMC6200-EVAL-Fabrication_Data_V1.2.zip"], ["Layout Data (PDF) V1.2", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Documents/TMC6200-EVAL-Layout_Data_V1.2.zip"]]}}
