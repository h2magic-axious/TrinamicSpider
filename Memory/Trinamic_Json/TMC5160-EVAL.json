{"model": "TMC5160-EVAL", "excerpt": "The TMC5160-EVAL allows you to explore all functions of the TMC5160-TA.The TMC5160-EVAL-KIT is a set of one MCU board Landungsbr\u00fccke, an Eselsbr\u00fccke bridge board and one TMC5160-EVAL driver board. It allows for a quick and simple start within only minutes to make your motor turning, while still providing full access to all registers and full functionality and diagnostics.For diagnosis, all signals between MCU and TMC5160 are accessible with probes on the Eselsbr\u00fccke bridge board. To simplify the transfer to your own processor platform the MCU board can be disconnected.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data. All settings can simply be exported for your own firmware project.More about the TMCL-IDESpecial FeaturesMicroPlyer\u2122CoolStep\u2122passive brakingshort detectionSpreadCycle\u2122Stall detectionStallGuard2\u2122StealthChop2\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Motor Supply": "8\u202660V", "Phase Current, RMS": "4.7A", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "a/b/n incremental": "Yes", "SPI": "Yes", "Step/Dir": "Yes", "UART": "Yes", "MicroPlyer\u2122": "Yes", "CoolStep\u2122": "Yes", "passive braking": "Yes", "short detection": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "Stall detection": "Yes", "StallGuard2\u2122": "Yes", "StealthChop2\u2122": "Yes"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Images/TMC5160-EVAL.jpg", "images": null, "resource": {"Datasheet": [["TMC5160 Datasheet", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC5160A_Datasheet_Rev1.14.pdf"], ["TMC5160 Datasheet - Chinese Version", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC5160A_Datasheet_Rev1_13_CN.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["TMC5160-EVAL BOM V3.1", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Documents/TMC5160-EVAL_V31-BOM.xls"]], "Drawings": [["PADS Files V3.1 (open with PADS VX2.4)", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Drawings/TMC5160-EVAL-CAD_Files_V3.1.zip"], ["Fabrication Data V3.1", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Drawings/TMC5160-EVAL-Fabrication_Data_V3.1.zip"], ["Layout Data (PDF) V3.1", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Drawings/TMC5160-EVAL-Layout_Data_V3.1.zip"]], "PCNs": [["PCN 2019-08-02 Hardware Change TMCx160A", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/EOL_PCN/PCN-2019-08-02_TMCx160A.pdf"]]}}
