{"model": "PD60-3-1076", "excerpt": "The PANdrive\u2122 PD57/60-x-1076 is a full mechatronic solution with state of the art feature set. It is highly integrated and offers a convenient handling.The PD57/60-x-1076 includes a stepper motor and driver electronics. The module is controlled via a step and direction interface. One configuration pin selects the current control mode between StealthChop\u2122 for absolute silent motor control and SpreadCycle\u2122 for high speed. A TTL UART interface allows for more advanced configuration, for example of the StallGuard2\u2122 and CoolStep\u2122 features, and permanent parameter storage via TMCL\u2122-IDE.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data.More about the TMCL-IDESpecial FeaturesMicroPlyer\u2122CoolStep\u2122SpreadCycle\u2122StallGuard2\u2122StealthChop\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Flange NEMA": "24", "Flange": "60mm", "Holding Torque": "210Ncm", "Motor Supply": "10\u202630V", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "Step/Dir": "Yes", "UART": "Yes", "TMCL\u2122": "Yes", "MicroPlyer\u2122": "Yes", "CoolStep\u2122": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "StallGuard2\u2122": "Yes", "StealthChop\u2122": "Yes", "Width": "60mm", "Height": "60mm", "Length": "78mm"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Images/PD60-3-1076.jpg", "images": null, "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Hardware Manual Rev 1.03", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Documents/PD-1076_hardware_manual_hw1.10_rev1.03.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["TMCL Firmware Manual FW V1.02 Rev 1.02", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Documents/PD-1076-TMCL_firmware_manual_fw1.02_rev1.02.pdf"]], "Software": [["TMCM-1076 Firmware V1.02", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1076_V102.hex"]], "Drawings": [["PD57-1-1076 STEP-File", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Drawings/PD57-1-1076_-_NEMA23.STEP"], ["PD57-2-1076 STEP-File", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Drawings/PD57-2-1076_-_NEMA23.STEP"], ["PD60-3-1076 STEP-File", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Drawings/PD60-3-1076_-_NEMA24.STEP"], ["PD60-4-1076 STEP-File", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Drawings/PD60-4-1076_-_NEMA24.STEP"]]}}
