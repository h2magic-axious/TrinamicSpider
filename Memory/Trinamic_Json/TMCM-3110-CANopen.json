{"model": "TMCM-3110-CANopen", "excerpt": "The TMCM-3110 is a triple axis stepper motor controller/driver module for sensorless load dependent current control. The device is powered by Trinamic StallGuard2\u2122, CoolStep\u2122 and SpreadCycle\u2122 technology and has a trapezoidal ramp generator. The TMCM-3110 is capable of driving up to 4A of current from each output (with proper heatsinking). It is designed for an operating voltage of 9...52V. The device provides a RS485, CAN, USB and 3 encoder interfaces. An integrated protocol processor supplies a high level TMCL/ CANopen communication.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data.More about the TMCL-IDESpecial FeaturesStallGuard2\u2122CoolStep\u2122SpreadCycle\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "3", "Motor Supply": "9\u202652V", "Phase Current, RMS": "2.8A", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "a/b/n incremental": "Yes", "CAN": "Yes", "RS485": "Yes", "Step/Dir": "Yes", "USB": "Yes", "CANopen": "Yes", "TMCL\u2122": "", "trapezoidal": "Yes", "StallGuard2\u2122": "Yes", "CoolStep\u2122": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "Width": "130mm", "Length": "100mm", "Height": "30mm"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Images/TMCM-3110.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Blockdiagrams/TMCM-3110_Blockdiagramm.svg"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Hardware Manual Rev 1.04", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-3110_hardware_manual_hw1.10_rev1.04.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["TMCL Firmware Manual FW V1.14 Rev 1.11", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-3110-TMCL_firmware_manual_fw1.17_rev1.14.pdf"], ["TMCL Firmware Manual FW V1.14 Rev 1.09", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-3110_TMCL-firmware_manual_V109.pdf"], ["TMCL Firmware Manual FW V1.11 Rev 1.05", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-3110_TMCL-firmware_manual_V105.pdf"], ["CANopen Firmware Manual FW V3.20 Rev 2.01", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-3110-CANopen_firmware_manual_fw3.20_rev_2.01.pdf"], ["CANopen Firmware Manual FW V3.16 Rev 2.00", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-3110_CANopen_firmware_manual.pdf"]], "Software": [["Setup Information (Trinamic_inf_cat)", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Software/Trinamic_inf_cat.zip"], ["TMCL Firmware V1.14", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-3110_V114.hex"], ["TMCL Firmware V1.11", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-3110_V111.hex"], ["TMCL Firmware V1.09", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-3110_V109.hex"], ["TMCL Firmware V1.07", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-3110_V107.hex"], ["CANopen Firmware V3.20 (hex and EDS file)", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-3110-CANopen_V320.zip"], ["CANopen Firmware V3.18 (hex and EDS file)", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-3110_CANopen_V318.zip"], ["CANopen Firmware V3.16 (hex and EDS file)", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-3110_CANopen_V316.zip"]], "Drawings": [["STEP-File V1.1", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Drawings/TMCM-3110_V11.stp"]], "PCNs": [["PCN-2017-07-04 - Firmware 3.20", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/PCNs/PCN_2017-07-04_Firmware_V320.pdf"]]}}
