  "excerpt": "For a quick evaluation of one of the Trinamic Breakout Boards (BOBs) without commiting to a processor, the USB-2-SD translates TMCL-IDE commands into Step/Direction pulses. Simply connect it directly via the USB type A compatible PCB footprint to your computer to communicate with the breakout board of your choice via S/D.Featuring Trinamic's TMC4330A-LA fully integrated stepper motor servo controller, the USB-2-SD allows for the flexible acceleration profiles of linear ramping, SixPoint\u2122 ramping, and S-shaped ramping. In addition, an incremental encoder (5V signal level) can be connected to the USB-2-SD to read back motor or joint position.The simple but powerful Step/Dir signal generator\u00a0can be controlled via Trinamic\u2019s TMCL protocol and commands, and is fully supported by the TMCL-IDE graphical user interface.",
