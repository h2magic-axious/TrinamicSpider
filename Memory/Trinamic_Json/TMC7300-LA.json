{"model": "TMC7300-LA", "excerpt": "Working from a single or dual Li-Ion cell or dual or more AA batteries the TMC7300 is optimally suited for battery operated equipment. Its two full-bridges allow either control of two DC motors, PWM-control of LEDs, or protected standalone peripheral driving, using a polarity signal per halfbridge. Operate up to two DC motors via simple UART control for direction, velocity and torque. Integrated power-MOSFETs with internal charge-pump for best-in-class RDSon even at low supply voltage, handle motor current up to 1.2A per motor continuously, or the double current in parallel connection. Together with a tiny standby current, this guarantees a long battery life. Protection and diagnostic features support robust and reliable operation. This advanced driver ensures efficient and reliable operation for cost-effective and highly competitive solutions.", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "2", "Motor Supply": "2\u202611V", "Microsteps": "", "UART": "Yes", "PWM (internal)": "Yes", "Current Limiter": "Yes", "Single & Dual Motor Option": "Yes", "Direct Phase Control": "Yes", "Phase Current, RMS": "2.0A", "Package": "QFN20 (3x3)"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Images/TMC7300-LA.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Blockdiagrams/TMC7300_Block_Diagramm.svg", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Pinouts/Pinning_7300.svg"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Datasheet Rev 1.05", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC7300_Datasheet_V105.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["Calculation Sheet", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC7300_Calculations.xlsx"]], "Additional Resources": [["Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)", "https://trinamic.comhttps://www.trinamic.com/support/faq/"], ["Application Programming Interface (API)", "https://trinamic.comhttps://www.trinamic.com/support/software/access-package/"], ["Blog article: TMC7300 example script", "https://trinamic.comhttps://blog.trinamic.com/2020/03/10/tmc7300-example-script/"]]}}
