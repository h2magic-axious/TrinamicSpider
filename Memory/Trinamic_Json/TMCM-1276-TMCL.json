{"model": "TMCM-1276-TMCL", "excerpt": "TMCM-1276 is an easy to use smart stepper motor driver module.The module is controlled via a CAN bus interface and comes with two firmware options \u2013 TMCL and CANopen. TMCM-1276 features StealthChop\u2122 for absolute silent motor control, SpreadCycle\u2122 for high speed stepper motor commutation, a fully integrated hardware motion controller with SixPoint\u2122 motion ramps, as well as StallGuard2\u2122 and CoolStep\u2122.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data.More about the TMCL-IDESpecial FeaturesCoolStep\u2122SpreadCycle\u2122StallGuard2\u2122StealthChop\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "1", "Motor Supply": "10\u202630V", "Phase Current, RMS": "3.0A", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "a/b/n incremental": "Yes", "Analog Hall": "Yes", "CAN": "Yes", "TMCL\u2122": "Yes", "CANopen": "", "SixPoint\u2122": "Yes", "CoolStep\u2122": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "StallGuard2\u2122": "Yes", "StealthChop\u2122": "Yes", "Width": "60mm", "Length": "60mm", "Height": "13mm"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Images/TMCM-1276.jpg", "images": null, "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Hardware Manual Rev 1.02", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1276-TMCL_firmware_manual_fw1.15_rev1.04.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["TMCL Firmware Manual FW V1.13 Rev 1.03", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1276-TMCL_firmware_manual_fw1.13_rev1.03.pdf"], ["CANopen Firmware Manual FW V3.22 Rev 1.00", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1276-CANopen_firmware_manual_fw3.22_rev1.00.pdf"]], "Software": [["TMCL Firmware V1.13", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1276_TMCL_V113.hex"], ["CANopen Firmware V3.22 (hex and EDS file)", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1276_CANopen_V322.zip"]], "Drawings": [["TMCM-1276 STEP-File", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Drawings/TMCM-1276_Housing.step"]]}}
