{"model": "TMC5031-LA", "excerpt": "The TMC5031 cDriver\u2122 is an integrated motor driver and motion controller solution for CCTV cameras, pumps and other automated equipment applications. The device has two integrated SixPoint\u2122 ramp controllers, microstepping indexers and the sensorless stall detection technology StallGuard2\u2122 and is intended to drive two bipolar stepper motor. The output driver blocks consists of low RDSon N-Channel power MOSFETs configured as full H-bridges to drive the motor windings. The TMC5031 is capable of driving up to 1.5A of current from each output (with proper heatsinking). TMC5031 is designed for a supply voltage of 5...16V. The device provides a SPI interface for configuration and diagnostics and a step and direction interface.Special Featuresmicrostep tableChopSync\u2122CoolStep\u2122short detectionSpreadCycle\u2122Stall detectionStallGuard2\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "2", "Motor Supply": "5\u202616V", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "SPI": "Yes", "trapezoidal": "Yes", "SixPoint\u2122": "Yes", "microstep table": "Yes", "ChopSync\u2122": "Yes", "CoolStep\u2122": "Yes", "short detection": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "Stall detection": "Yes", "StallGuard2\u2122": "Yes", "Phase Current, RMS": "1.1A", "Package": "QFN48 (7x7)"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Images/tmc5031-LA.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Blockdiagrams/TMC5031-LA-V2.svg", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Pinouts/TMC5031-LA.svg"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Datasheet Rev 1.12", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC5031_datasheet_Rev1.12.pdf"]], "Application Notes": [["AN 005k - PCB Footprint Guidelines QFN48 7x7", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/AN005k-IC_Package_PCB_Footprint_Guidelines_QFN48_7x7.pdf"], ["AN 028 - Extending Positioning Range TMC5xxx", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Appnotes/AN028-Extending_the_positioning_range_of_TMC5XXX.pdf"], ["AN 031 - VCC IO supply", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/AN031-TMC50XX_VCC_IO_supply.pdf"]], "Quality": [["Statement concerning RoHS compliance of TMC5031", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Company/Quality/RoHS_ICs/TMC5031_RoHS.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["Excel Calculations Sheet", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC50XX_Calculations.xlsx"]], "Additional Resources": [["Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)", "https://trinamic.comhttps://www.trinamic.com/support/faq/"], ["Application Programming Interface (API)", "https://trinamic.comhttps://www.trinamic.com/support/software/access-package/"]]}}
