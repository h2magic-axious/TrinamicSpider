{"model": "PD28-3-1021", "excerpt": "PD28-1021 is a full mechatronic solution including a 28mm flange motor (NEMA11). It joins a convenient controller electronic and a SensOstep\u2122 encoder with a range of different motor torques. PD28-1021offers two motor torque options and can be controlled via RS-485 serial interface. The powersupply, interface and the multi purpose I/Os can be connected via a single small JST connectors.Communication traffic is kept low since all time critical operations, e.g. ramp calculation are performed on board. Full remote control of device with feedback is possible. The firmware of the module can be updated via the serial interface.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data.More about the TMCL-IDESpecial FeaturesStallGuard2\u2122CoolStep\u2122SpreadCycle\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Flange NEMA": "11", "Flange": "28mm", "Holding Torque": "12Ncm", "Motor Supply": "9\u202628V", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "RS485": "Yes", "Step/Dir": "Yes", "SensOstep\u2122": "Yes", "TMCL\u2122": "Yes", "trapezoidal": "Yes", "StallGuard2\u2122": "Yes", "CoolStep\u2122": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "Width": "28mm", "Height": "28mm", "Length": "62mm"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Images/PD28-3-1021.jpg", "images": null, "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Hardware Manual Rev 1.03", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Documents/PD-1021_hardware_manual_hw1.40_rev1.03.pdf"], ["PD-1021 Short Spec", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Documents/PD-1021_shortSpec.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["PD-1021 Getting Started", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Documents/PD-1021_getting_started_V1.0.pdf"], ["TMCL firmware manual revision 1.05 for firmware V1.42", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Documents/PD28-1021_TMCL-firmware_manual_Fw1.42_Rev1.05.pdf"], ["TMCL firmware manual revision 1.06 for firmware V1.29", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Documents/PD-1021_TMCL_firmware_manual.pdf"]], "Software": [["TMCL firmware V1.42", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1021_V142.hex"], ["TMCL firmware V1.29", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1021_V129.hex"]], "PCNs": [["PCN PD28-x-1021", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/EOL_PCN/PCN_2016-01-01_TMCM-1021.pdf"], ["PCN-2017-07-02 - Firmware 1.42", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/PCNs/PCN_2017-07-02_Firmware_V142.pdf"]], "Drawings": [["PD28-1-1021 STEP-File", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Drawings/PD28-1-1021.stp"], ["PD28-3-1021 STEP-File", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Drawings/PD28-3-1021.stp"]]}}
