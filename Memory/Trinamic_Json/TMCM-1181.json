{"model": "TMCM-1181", "excerpt": "The TMCM-1181 is a single axis stepper motor controller/driver module for sensorless load dependent current control. The device is powered by Trinamic StallGuard2\u2122, CoolStep\u2122 and SpreadCycle\u2122 chopper technology and has a trapezoidal ramp generator. The TMCM-1181 is capable of driving up to 9A of current from each output (with proper heatsinking). It is designed for an operating voltage of 11...28V. The device provides a RS485, USB and GP-in interface. An integrated protocol processor supplies a high level TMCL communication.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data.More about the TMCL-IDESpecial FeaturesStallGuard2\u2122CoolStep\u2122SpreadCycle\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "1", "Motor Supply": "11\u202628V", "Phase Current, RMS": "6.4A", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "RS485": "Yes", "Step/Dir": "Yes", "USB": "Yes", "SensOstep\u2122": "Yes", "TMCL\u2122": "Yes", "trapezoidal": "Yes", "StallGuard2\u2122": "Yes", "CoolStep\u2122": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "Width": "86mm", "Length": "86mm", "Height": "27mm"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Images/TMCM-1181.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Blockdiagrams/TMCM-1181_Block_Diagram.svg"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Hardware Manual Rev 0.90", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1181_hardware_manual_hw3.00_rev0.90.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["TMCL Firmware Manual Revision V1.02 for Firmware V1.42", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1181_TMCL-firmware_manual_Fw1.42_Rev1.02.pdf"], ["TMCL Firmware Manual Revision V0.90 for Firmware V1.26", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1181_TMCL_firmware_manual.pdf"]], "Software": [["Setup Information (Trinamic_inf_cat)", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Software/Trinamic_inf_cat.zip"], ["Firmware V1.42", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1181_V142.hex"], ["Firmware V1.36", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1181_V136.hex"]], "Drawings": [["STEP-File V3.0", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Drawings/TMCM-1181_V30.stp"]]}}
