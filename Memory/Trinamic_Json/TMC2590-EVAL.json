{"model": "TMC2590-EVAL", "excerpt": "The TMC2590-EVAL allows you to explore all functions of the TMC2590-TA.The TMC2590-EVAL-KIT is a set of one MCU board Landungsbr\u00fccke, a Eselsbr\u00fccke\u00a0bridge board and one TMC2590-EVAL driver board. It allows for a quick and simple start within only minutes to make your motor turning, while still providing full access to all registers and full functionality and diagnostics.For diagnosis, all signals between MCU and TMC2590\u00a0are accessible with probes on the bridge board. TMC2590-EVAL can be used with or without the Landungsbr\u00fccke\u00a0MCU board. Compehensive sample code can be found in Trinamics Technology Access Package TTAP.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data. All settings can simply be exported for your own firmware project.More about the TMCL-IDESpecial FeaturesMicroPlyer\u2122break before makeCoolStep\u2122short detectionslope controlSpreadCycle\u2122Stall detectionStallGuard2\u2122Current Sense", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Motor Supply": "5\u202660V", "Phase Current, RMS": "", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "SPI": "Yes", "Step/Dir": "Yes", "MicroPlyer\u2122": "Yes", "break before make": "Yes", "CoolStep\u2122": "Yes", "short detection": "Yes", "slope control": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "Stall detection": "Yes", "StallGuard2\u2122": "Yes", "Current Sense": "Yes"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Images/TMC2590-EVAL.jpg", "images": null, "resource": {"Datasheet": [["TMC2590 Datasheet", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC2590_datasheet_V1.02.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["TMC2590-EVAL Manual", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Documents/TMC2590-Eval_user_manual_Rev1.01.pdf"]], "Drawings": [["KiCad Files V1.1", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Drawings/TMC2590-EVAL-CAD_Files_V1.1.zip"], ["Fabrication Data V1.1", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Drawings/TMC2590-EVAL-Fabrication_Data_V1.1.zip"], ["Layout Data (PDF) V1.1", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Drawings/TMC2590-EVAL-Layout_Data_V1.1.zip"]]}}
