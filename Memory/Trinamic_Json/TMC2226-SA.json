{"model": "TMC2226-SA", "excerpt": "The TMC2226 is an ultra-silent motor driver IC for two phase stepper motors. TRINAMIC's sophisticated StealthChop2\u2122 chopper ensures noiseless operation, maximum efficiency and best motor torque. Its fast current regulation and optional combination with SpreadCycle\u2122 allow highly dynamic motion while adding. StallGuard4\u2122 provides sensorless homing. The integrated power MOSFETs handle motor currents up to 2A RMS with protection and diagnostic features for robust and reliable operation. A simple to use UART interface opens up tuning and control options. Industries\u2019 most advanced Step/Dir stepper motor driver family upgrades designs to noiseless and most precise operation for cost-effective and highly competitive solutions.Special FeaturesMicroPlyer\u2122CoolStep\u2122SpreadCycle\u2122StealthChop2\u2122StallGuard4\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "1", "Motor Supply": "4.75\u202629V", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "Step/Dir": "Yes", "UART": "Yes", "MicroPlyer\u2122": "Yes", "CoolStep\u2122": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "StealthChop2\u2122": "Yes", "StallGuard4\u2122": "Yes", "Phase Current, RMS": "2.0A", "Package": "HTSSOP28 (9.7x6.4)"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Images/TMC2226-SA.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Blockdiagrams/TMC2226_Block_Diagram.png"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Datasheet Rev 1.06", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC2226_Datasheet_V106.pdf"]], "Software": [["Calculation Sheet", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC2226_Calculations.xlsx"]], "Additional Resources": [["Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)", "https://trinamic.comhttps://www.trinamic.com/support/faq/"], ["Application Programming Interface (API)", "https://trinamic.comhttps://www.trinamic.com/support/software/access-package/"]]}}
