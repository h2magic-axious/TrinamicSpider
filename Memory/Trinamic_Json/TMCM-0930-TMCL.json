{"model": "TMCM-0930-TMCL", "excerpt": "The TMCM-0930-TMCL is a slot type microcontroller module that can control up to four Trinamic slot type motor driver modules using TMCL commands. The stepper and/or BLDC motor modules are controlled by TMCM-0930-TMCL on a special slot type baseboard while using RS485 bus and some control signals throughout the whole system. TMCM-0930-TMCL is equipped with additional RS485 interface, a CAN bus interface, and a USB interface for external communiciation. The TMCM-0930-TMCL can also store and execute TMCL programs.", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "", "Motor Supply": "", "Phase Current, RMS": "", "Microsteps": "", "CAN": "Yes", "RS485": "Yes", "USB": "Yes", "GPIO": "Yes", "TMCL\u2122": "Yes", "Width": "40mm", "Length": "45mm", "Height": "20mm"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Images/TMCM-0930-TMCL.jpg", "images": null, "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Hardware Manual", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-0930_TMCL_hardware_manual_Hw1.2_Rev1.00.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["TMCL Firmware Manual for Firmware V1.00", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-0930_TMCL_firmware_manual_Fw1.00_Rev1.00.pdf"]], "Software": [["TMCL Firmware V1.00", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-0930_TMCL_V100.hex"]], "Drawings": [["STEP File V1.2", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Drawings/3D_STEP_TMCM-0930_V12.zip"]]}}
