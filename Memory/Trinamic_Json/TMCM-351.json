{"model": "TMCM-351", "excerpt": "The TMCM-351 is a compact and powerful triple axis 2-phase stepper motor controller and driver module. It provides a complete motion control solution at a small size for embedded applications. Using the integrated additional I/Os it even can do complete system control applications. The motors and switches can be connected easily with screw or crimp style connectors. The connection of the I/Os and encoder can be made via two row header. All time critical operations, e.g. ramp calculation are performed on board. With the StallGuard\u2122 feature it is possible to detect overload and stall of the motor. The firmware of the module can be updated via the serial interface. The TMCM-351-E is equipped with an 3-axis incremental encoder interface for position monitoring. The TMCL\u2122 firmware option comes with the PC based software development environment TMCL-IDE. Using predefined TMCL (Trinamic Motion Control Language) high level commands like \"move to position\" or \"constant rotation\" rapid and fast development of motion control applications is guaranteed. Host communication is possible via USB, RS-232, RS-485 or CAN interface. A user TMCL program can be stored in the on board EEPROM for stand-alone operation. With the CANopen firmware option it is possible to operate the module in CANopen networks together with other equipment.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data.More about the TMCL-IDESpecial FeaturesStallGuard\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "3", "Motor Supply": "7\u202628.5V", "Phase Current, RMS": "2.8A", "Microsteps": "1\u202664", "a/b/n incremental": "Yes", "CAN": "Yes", "RS232": "Yes", "RS485": "Yes", "USB": "Yes", "CANopen": "Yes", "TMCL\u2122": "Yes", "trapezoidal": "Yes", "StallGuard\u2122": "Yes", "Width": "160mm", "Length": "100mm", "Height": "29mm"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Images/TMCM-351.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Blockdiagrams/TMCM-351.svg"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Hardware Manual Rev 1.07", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-351_hardware_manual_hw1.20_rev1.07.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["TMCL Firmware Manual FW V4.45 Rev 1.06", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-351-TMCL_firmware_manual_fw4.45_rev1.06.pdf"], ["CANopen Firmware Manual FW V3.20 Rev 2.01", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/CANopen_firmware_manual_TMCM-341_342_343_351_V2.01.pdf"], ["CANopen Firmware Manual FW V3.18 Rev 2.00", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-34x_CANopen_firmware_manual.pdf"]], "Drawings": [["TMCM-351 STEP-File V1.2", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Drawings/TMCM-351_V12.step"]], "Software": [["Setup Information (Trinamic_inf_cat)", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Software/Trinamic_inf_cat.zip"], ["TMCL Firmware V4.48", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-351_V448.hex"], ["TMCL Firmware V4.45", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-351_V445.hex"], ["TMCL Firmware V4.42", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-351_V442.hex"], ["TMCL Firmware V4.41", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-351_V441.hex"], ["CANopen Firmware V3.20 (hex and EDS file)", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-351-CANopen-V320_Firmware.zip"], ["CANopen Firmware V3.18 (hex and EDS file)", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-351_CANopen_V318.zip"], ["CANopen Firmware V3.09 (hex and EDS file)", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-351_CANopen_V309.zip"], ["CANopen Firmware V3.05 (hex and EDS file)", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-351_CANopen_V305.zip"], ["CANopen Firmware V3.03 (hex and EDS file)", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-351_CANopen_V303.zip"]], "PCNs": [["PCN-2017-07-04 - Firmware 3.20", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/PCNs/PCN_2017-07-04_Firmware_V320.pdf"]]}}
