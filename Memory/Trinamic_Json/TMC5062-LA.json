{"model": "TMC5062-LA", "excerpt": "The TMC5062 cDriver\u2122 is an integrated motor driver and motion controller solution for CCTV cameras, pumps and other automated equipment applications. The device has two integrated SixPoint\u2122 ramp controllers, microstepping indexers, the sensorless stall detection technology StallGuard2\u2122 and the load dependent speed control DcStep\u2122 and is intended to drive two bipolar stepper motor. The output driver blocks consists of low RDSon N-Channel power MOSFETs configured as full H-bridges to drive the motor windings. The TMC5062 is capable of driving up to 1.5A of current from each output (with proper heatsinking). TMC5062 is designed for a supply voltage of 5...20V. For high reliability requirements an Encoder interface provides feedback over the system status. The device provides a SPI interface for configuration and diagnostics and a step and direction interface.Special FeaturesDcStep\u2122microstep tableChopSync\u2122CoolStep\u2122short detectionSpreadCycle\u2122Stall detectionStallGuard2\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "2", "Motor Supply": "5\u202620V", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "a/b/n incremental": "Yes", "SPI": "Yes", "UART": "Yes", "SixPoint\u2122": "Yes", "trapezoidal": "Yes", "DcStep\u2122": "Yes", "microstep table": "Yes", "ChopSync\u2122": "Yes", "CoolStep\u2122": "Yes", "short detection": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "Stall detection": "Yes", "StallGuard2\u2122": "Yes", "Phase Current, RMS": "1.1A", "Package": "QFN48 (7x7)"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Images/TMC5062-LA.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Blockdiagrams/TMC5062-LA-V2.svg", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Pinouts/TMC5062-LA.svg"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Datasheet Rev 1.12", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC5062_datasheet_Rev1.12.pdf"]], "Application Notes": [["AN 005k - PCB Footprint Guidelines QFN48 7x7", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/AN005k-IC_Package_PCB_Footprint_Guidelines_QFN48_7x7.pdf"], ["AN 003 - dcStep basics and wizard", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Appnotes/AN003_-_dcStep_Basics_and_Wizard.pdf"], ["AN 028 - Extending Positioning Range TMC5xxx", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Appnotes/AN028-Extending_the_positioning_range_of_TMC5XXX.pdf"], ["AN 030 - TMC5062 3 Phase Motor", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Appnotes/AN030-TMC5062_3_Phase_Motor.pdf"], ["AN 031 - VCC IO supply", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Appnotes/AN031-TMC50XX_VCC_IO_supply.pdf"], ["AN 034 - TMC5062 Double Motor Current", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Appnotes/AN034-TMC5062_Double_Motor_Current.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["Statement concerning RoHS compliance of TMC5062", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Company/Quality/RoHS_ICs/TMC5062_RoHS.pdf"]], "Software": [["Excel Calculations Sheet", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC50XX_Calculations.xlsx"]], "Additional Resources": [["Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)", "https://trinamic.comhttps://www.trinamic.com/support/faq/"], ["Application Programming Interface (API)", "https://trinamic.comhttps://www.trinamic.com/support/software/access-package/"]]}}
