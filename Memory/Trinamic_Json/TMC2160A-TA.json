{"model": "TMC2160A-TA", "excerpt": "The TMC2160 is a high-power stepper motor driver IC with SPI interface. It features industries\u2019 most advanced stepper motor driver with simple Step/Dir interface.Using external transistors, highly dynamic, high torque drives can be realized. Based on Trinamic's sophisticated SpreadCycle and StealthChop choppers, the driver ensures absolutely noiseless operation combined with maximum efficiency and best motor torque. High integration, high energy efficiency and a small form factor enable miniaturized and scalable systems for cost effective solutions.The fully compatible TMC5160 offers an additional motion controller to make stepper motor control even easier.Special Featuresmicrostep tableMicroPlyer\u2122CoolStep\u2122passive brakingshort detectionSpreadCycle\u2122Stall detectionStallGuard2\u2122StealthChop2\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "1", "Motor Supply": "8\u202660V", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "SPI": "Yes", "Step/Dir": "Yes", "microstep table": "Yes", "MicroPlyer\u2122": "Yes", "CoolStep\u2122": "Yes", "passive braking": "Yes", "short detection": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "Stall detection": "Yes", "StallGuard2\u2122": "Yes", "StealthChop2\u2122": "Yes", "Phase Current, RMS": "", "Package": "eTQFP48 (7x7)"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Images/TMC2160A-TA.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Blockdiagrams/TMC2160-V2.svg", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Pinouts/TMC2160.svg"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Datasheet Rev 1.06", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC2160A-datasheet_Rev1.06.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["Calculation Sheet", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC2160_Calculations.xlsx"]], "Drawings": [["EAGLE Files V1.0", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC2160_EAGLE_Files_V1.0.zip"], ["PADS Files V1.0", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC2160_PADS_Files_V1.0.zip"]], "Quality": [["Statement concerning RoHS compliance of TMC2160", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Company/Quality/RoHS_ICs/TMC2160_RoHS.pdf"]], "Application Notes": [["AN 005a - PCB Footprint Guidelines eTQFP48", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/AN005a-IC_Package_PCB_Footprint_Guidelines_eTQFP48.pdf"]], "PCNs": [["PCN 2019-08-02 Hardware Change TMCx160A", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/EOL_PCN/PCN-2019-08-02_TMCx160A.pdf"]], "Additional Resources": [["Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)", "https://trinamic.comhttps://www.trinamic.com/support/faq/"], ["Application Programming Interface (API)", "https://trinamic.comhttps://www.trinamic.com/support/software/access-package/"]]}}
