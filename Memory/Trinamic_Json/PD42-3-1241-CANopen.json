{"model": "PD42-3-1241-CANopen", "excerpt": "The PD42-X-1241 family provides small and compact full mechatronic solutions including a NEMA17 / 42mm flange size stepper motor of different length and torque, the TMCM-1241 controller / driver electronics and Trinamic SensOstep\u2122 encoder for step-loss detection. The PANdrive smart motors include a stepper motor with high current coil windings (up-to 3A RMS) designed especially for higher speed operations (when comparing with the PD42-x-1240 line of PANdrives\u2122).\u00a0All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data.More about the TMCL-IDESpecial FeaturesCoolStep\u2122SpreadCycle\u2122StallGuard2\u2122StealthChop\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Flange NEMA": "17", "Flange": "42mm", "Holding Torque": "40Ncm", "Motor Supply": "10\u202630V", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "CAN": "Yes", "RS485": "Yes", "Step/Dir": "Yes", "USB": "Yes", "GPIO": "Yes", "SensOstep\u2122": "Yes", "TMCL\u2122": "", "CANopen": "Yes", "SixPoint\u2122": "Yes", "CoolStep\u2122": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "StallGuard2\u2122": "Yes", "StealthChop\u2122": "Yes", "Width": "42mm", "Height": "42mm", "Length": "60mm"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Images/PD-42-3-1241-TMCL-1442.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Blockdiagrams/PD-1241_Blockdiagramm.svg"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Hardware Manual Rev 1.25", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Documents/PD-1241_hardware_manual_hw1.00_rev1.25.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["TMCL Firmware Manual for Firmware V1.44", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Documents/PD42-1241_TMCL_firmware_manual_Fw1.44_Rev1.01.pdf"], ["CANopen Firmware Manual for Firmware 3.21", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Documents/PD42-1241_CANopen_firmware_manual_Fw3.21_Rev1.00.pdf"]], "Software": [["TMCL Firmware V1.44", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Software/TMCM-1241_TMCL_V144.hex"], ["CANopen Firmware V3.21 (hex and EDS file)", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Software/TMCM-1241_CANopen_V321.zip"]], "Drawings": [["PD42-3-1241 STEP-File", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Drawings/PD42-3-1241.STEP"], ["PD42-4-1241 STEP-File", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Drawings/PD42-4-1241.STEP"]]}}
