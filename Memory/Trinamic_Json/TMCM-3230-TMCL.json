{"model": "TMCM-3230-TMCL", "excerpt": "The TMCM-3230 is a compact and easy to use 3-axes stepper motor controller and driver unit for embedded applications. It offers CAN bus, UART and USB interfaces for communication and supports stand-alone operation, also. The TMCM-3230 features StealthChop\u2122 for absolute silent motor control, SpreadCycle\u2122 for high speed stepper motor commutation, a fully integrated hardware motion controller with SixPoint\u2122 motion ramps, as well as StallGuard2\u2122 and CoolStep\u2122.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data.More about the TMCL-IDESpecial Featuresmicrostep tableMicroPlyer\u2122CoolStep\u2122passive brakingshort detectionSpreadCycle\u2122Stall detectionStallGuard2\u2122StealthChop\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "3", "Motor Supply": "9\u202628.5V", "Phase Current, RMS": "1.0A", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "CAN": "Yes", "RS232": "Yes", "RS422": "Yes", "RS485": "Yes", "SPI": "Yes", "UART": "Yes", "USB": "Yes", "CANopen": "", "TMCL\u2122": "Yes", "SixPoint\u2122": "Yes", "trapezoidal": "Yes", "microstep table": "Yes", "MicroPlyer\u2122": "Yes", "CoolStep\u2122": "Yes", "passive braking": "Yes", "short detection": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "Stall detection": "Yes", "StallGuard2\u2122": "Yes", "StealthChop\u2122": "Yes", "Width": "80mm", "Length": "50mm", "Height": "6mm"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Images/TMCM-3230.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Blockdiagrams/TMCM-3230.svg"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Hardware Manual Rev 1.30", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-3230_hardware_manual_hw1.30_rev1.30.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["CANopen Firmware Manual FW V3.21 Rev 1.05", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-3230_CANopen_firmware_manual_Fw3.21_Rev1.05.pdf"], ["CANopen Firmware Manual FW V3.20 Rev 1.03", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-3230-CANopen_firmware_manual_fw3.20_rev1.04.pdf"], ["TMCL Firmware Manual FW V1.07 Rev 1.05", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-3230-TMCL_firmware_manual_fw1.07_rev1.05.pdf"], ["TMCM-3230 Mating Connectors (Datasheets)", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-3230_mating_connectors.zip"]], "Software": [["CANopen Firmware V3.21 (hex and EDS file)", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-3230_CANopen_V321.zip"], ["CANopen Firmware V3.20 (hex and EDS file)", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-3230-CANopen_V320.hex"], ["TMCL Firmware V1.07", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-3230_TMCL_V107.hex"]], "PCNs": [["PCN-2018-03-02 Firmware V3.21", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/PCN_2018-03-02_Firmware_V321.pdf"]]}}
