{"model": "TMC5130A-TA", "excerpt": "The TMC5130 cDriver\u2122 is an integrated motor driver and motion controller solution for 3D-Printing, CCTV cameras, pumps and other automated equipment applications. The device has an integrated SixPoint\u2122 ramp controller, a microstepping indexer, the sensorless stall detection technology StallGuard2\u2122 and the completely noiseless current control mode StealthChop\u2122 and is intended to drive a bipolar stepper motor. The output driver block consists of low RDSon N-Channel power MOSFETs configured as full H-bridges to drive the motor windings. The TMC5130 is capable of driving up to 2.5A of current from each output (with proper heatsinking). TMC5130 is designed for a supply voltage of 5...46V. The device provides a SPI interface for configuration and diagnostics and a step and direction interface.Special Featuresmicrostep tableMicroPlyer\u2122CoolStep\u2122passive brakingshort detectionSpreadCycle\u2122Stall detectionStallGuard2\u2122StealthChop\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "1", "Motor Supply": "4.75\u202646V", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "a/b/n incremental": "Yes", "Analog Hall": "Yes", "PWM": "Yes", "SPI": "Yes", "Step/Dir": "Yes", "UART": "Yes", "SixPoint\u2122": "Yes", "trapezoidal": "Yes", "microstep table": "Yes", "MicroPlyer\u2122": "Yes", "CoolStep\u2122": "Yes", "passive braking": "Yes", "short detection": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "Stall detection": "Yes", "StallGuard2\u2122": "Yes", "StealthChop\u2122": "Yes", "Phase Current, RMS": "1.4A", "Package": "eTQFP48 (7x7)"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Images/tmc5130A-TA.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Blockdiagrams/TMC5130A-TA-V2.svg", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Pinouts/TMC5130A-TA.svg"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Datasheet Rev 1.17", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC5130_datasheet_Rev1.17.pdf"]], "Software": [["Example", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/CRC-SimpleExample.zip"], ["UART-CRC-Calculator", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Software/UART-CRC-calculator.zip"]], "Documentation": [["Acceleration and Velocity Calculation Sheet", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC5130_TMC2130_TMC2100_Calculations.xlsx"], ["Statement concerning RoHS compliance of TMC5130", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Company/Quality/RoHS_ICs/TMC5130_RoHS.pdf"]], "Application Notes": [["AN 005a - PCB Footprint Guidelines eTQFP48", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/AN005a-IC_Package_PCB_Footprint_Guidelines_eTQFP48.pdf"], ["AN 028 - Extending Positioning Range TMC5xxx", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Appnotes/AN028-Extending_the_positioning_range_of_TMC5XXX.pdf"]], "Additional Resources": [["Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)", "https://trinamic.comhttps://www.trinamic.com/support/faq/"], ["Application Programming Interface (API)", "https://trinamic.comhttps://www.trinamic.com/support/software/access-package/"]]}}
