{"model": "TMCM-1070", "excerpt": "The TMCM-1070 is a single axis stepper motor controller/driver module for sensorless load dependent current control. The device is powered by Trinamic SpreadCycle\u2122 chopper and StealthChop\u2122 technology. The TMCM-1070 is capable of driving up to 1.4A of current from each output (with proper heatsinking). It is designed for an operating voltage of 9...24V. The device provides a S/D interface and permanent parameter storage via TMCL\u2122-IDE for configuration.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data.More about the TMCL-IDESpecial FeaturesMicroPlyer\u2122microstep tableCoolStep\u2122SpreadCycle\u2122StallGuard2\u2122StealthChop\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "1", "Motor Supply": "9\u202624V", "Phase Current, RMS": "1.2A", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "Step/Dir": "Yes", "UART": "Yes", "TMCL\u2122": "Yes", "MicroPlyer\u2122": "Yes", "microstep table": "Yes", "CoolStep\u2122": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "StallGuard2\u2122": "Yes", "StealthChop\u2122": "Yes", "Width": "42mm", "Length": "42mm", "Height": "12mm"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Images/TMCM-1070.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Blockdiagrams/TMCM-1070.svg"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Hardware Manual Rev 1.10", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1070_hardware_manual_hw1.00_rev1.10.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["TMCL Firmware Manual FW V1.10 Rev1.40", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1070-TMCL_firmware_manual_fw1.01_rev1.40.pdf"]], "Drawings": [["STEP-File V1.0", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Drawings/TMCM-1070_V10.stp"]]}}
