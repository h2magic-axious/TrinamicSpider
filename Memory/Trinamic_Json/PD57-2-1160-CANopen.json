{"model": "PD57-2-1160-CANopen", "excerpt": "The PD57-1160 and PD60-1160 PANdrive\u2122 familly is a full mechatronic solution including a high torque stepper motor and a motion controller/driver using the new outstanding CoolStep\u2122 technology for sensorless load dependent current control. This allows the first time an energy efficient operation of an open-loop stepper motor system. With the advanced StallGuard2\u2122 feature the load of the motor can be detected with high resolution.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data.More about the TMCL-IDESpecial FeaturesStallGuard2\u2122CoolStep\u2122SpreadCycle\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Flange NEMA": "23", "Flange": "57mm", "Holding Torque": "101Ncm", "Motor Supply": "9\u202651V", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "a/b/n incremental": "Yes", "CAN": "Yes", "RS485": "Yes", "Step/Dir": "Yes", "USB": "Yes", "SensOstep\u2122": "Yes", "TMCL\u2122": "", "CANopen": "Yes", "trapezoidal": "Yes", "StallGuard2\u2122": "Yes", "CoolStep\u2122": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "Width": "60mm", "Height": "60mm", "Length": "71mm"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Images/PD57-2-1160.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Blockdiagrams/PD-1160_Block_Diagram.svg"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Hardware Manual Rev 1.01", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Documents/PD-1160_hardware_manual_hw1.10_rev1.02.pdf"], ["Short Specification", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Documents/PD-1160_ShortSpec.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["TMCL Firmware Manual Revision V1.06 for Firmware V1.42", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Documents/PD-1160_TMCL-firmware_manual_Fw1.42_Rev1.06.pdf"], ["TMCL Firmware Manual Revision V1.04 for Firmware V1.27", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Documents/PD-1160_TMCL_firmware_manual.pdf"], ["CANopen Firmware Manual Revision V2.11 for Firmware V3.20", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Documents/PD-1160-CANopen_firmware_manual_fw3.20_rev2.11.pdf"], ["CANopen Firmware Manual Revision V2.00 for Firmware V3.16", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1160_CANopen_V320.zip"]], "Software": [["Setup Information (Trinamic_inf_cat)", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Software/Trinamic_inf_cat.zip"], ["TMCL Firmware V1.42", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1160_V142.hex"], ["TMCL Firmware V1.27", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1160_V127.hex"], ["CANopen Firmware V3.20", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1160_CANopen_V320.zip"]], "PCNs": [["PCN-2017-07-02 - Firmware 1.42", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/PCNs/PCN_2017-07-02_Firmware_V142.pdf"], ["PCN-2017-07-04 - Firmware 3.20", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/PCNs/PCN_2017-07-04_Firmware_V320.pdf"], ["PCN Firmware V1.27", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/EOL_PCN/2013_09_03_pcn_Firmware_V127.pdf"]], "Drawings": [["PD57-1-1160 STEP-File", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Drawings/PD57-1-1160.stp"], ["PD57-2-1160 STEP-File", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Drawings/PD57-2-1160.stp"], ["PD60-3-1160 STEP-Files", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Drawings/PD60-3-1160.stp"], ["PD60-4-1160 STEP-Files", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Drawings/PD60-4-1160.stp"]]}}
