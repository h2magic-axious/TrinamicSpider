{"model": "TMCM-1043", "excerpt": "The TMCM-1043 is a single axis stepper motor controller/driver module for sensorless load dependent current control. The device is powered by Trinamic StallGuard2\u2122, CoolStep\u2122 and SpreadCycle\u2122 chopper technology. The TMCM-1043 is capable of driving up to 1.6A of current from each output (with proper heatsinking). It is designed for an operating voltage of 9...28V. The device provides a S/D interface. An integrated protocol processor supplies a high level TMCL communication.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data.More about the TMCL-IDESpecial Featuresshort detectionSpreadCycle\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "1", "Motor Supply": "9\u202628V", "Phase Current, RMS": "1.1A", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "Step/Dir": "Yes", "short detection": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "Width": "37mm", "Length": "37mm", "Height": ""}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Images/TMCM-1043.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Blockdiagrams/TMCM-1043.svg"], "resource": {"Documentation": [["TMCM-1043.inf (driver)", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1043.inf"], ["Short manual", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1043_Short_Manual.pdf"]], "Software": [["USB serial programmer V0.91", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1043_USB_serial_programmer_V091.zip"], ["USB serial programmer V0.90", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1043_USB_serial_programmer_V090.zip"]]}}
