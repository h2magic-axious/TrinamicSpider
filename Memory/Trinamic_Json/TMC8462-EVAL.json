{"model": "TMC8462-EVAL", "excerpt": "The TMC8462-EVAL allows you to explore all functions of the TMC8462-BA.The TMC8462-EVAL board allows for a quick and simple start within only minutes to make your motor turning, while still providing full access to all registers and full functionality and diagnostics.For diagnosis, all signals between MCU and TMC8462 are accessible with probes on the Eselsbr\u00fccke bridge board.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data. All settings can simply be exported for your own firmware project.More about the TMCL-IDE", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Motor Supply": "5\u202635V", "Phase Current, RMS": "", "Microsteps": "", "EtherCAT\u00ae": "Yes", "IIC": "Yes", "PWM": "Yes", "SPI": "Yes", "Step/Dir": "Yes"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Images/TMC8462-EVAL.jpg", "images": null, "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Datasheet Rev 1.10", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Software/TMC8462_datasheet_Rev1.6.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["TMC8462-EVAL Manual", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Documents/TMC8462-EVAL_user_manual_rev1.00.pdf"]], "Drawings": [["TMC8462-EVAL Design Files V3.1", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Drawings/TMC8462-EVAL_V31.ZIP"]], "Software": [["TMC8462 SSC Support Package", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Software/TMC8461_TMC8462_SSC_SupportPackage.ZIP"], ["Trinamic Evaluation Board", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Software/TrinamicEvaluationBoard.xml"], ["Startrampe Firmware for TMC846x", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Software/Startrampe-TMC846x.hex"], ["Landungsbr\u00fccke Firmware for TMC846x", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Software/Landungsbruecke-TMC846x.hex"]], "Application Notes": [["Application Note 023 - ABN Encoder with TMC8462", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Appnotes/AN023_ABN_Encoder_with_TMC8462.PDF"], ["Application Note 054 - EtherCAT using realtime TC3", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Appnotes/AN054_Ethercat_using_realtime_TC3.pdf"], ["TMC8462-EVAL Device Emulation for Application Note 023", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Appnotes/TMC8462-EVAL_DeviceEmulation_ABN_Appnote.xml"]]}}
