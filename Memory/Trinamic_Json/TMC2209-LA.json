{"model": "TMC2209-LA", "excerpt": "The TMC2209 is an ultra-silent motor driver IC\u00a0for two phase stepper motors.\u00a0Trinamic's sophisticated StealthChop2 chopper ensures noiseless operation, maximum efficiency and best motor torque. Its fast current regulation and optional combination with SpreadCycle allow highly dynamic motion while adding\u00a0StallGuard4 for sensorless homing. The integrated power MOSFETs handle motor currents up to 2A RMS with protection and diagnostic features for robust and reliable operation. A simple to use UART interface opens up tuning and control options. Store application tuning to OTP memory. Industries\u2019 most advanced Step/Dir stepper motor driver family upgrades designs to noiseless and most precise operation for cost-effective and highly competitive solutions.Special FeaturesMicroPlyer\u2122CoolStep\u2122short detectionSpreadCycle\u2122Stall detectionStealthChop2\u2122StallGuard4\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "1", "Motor Supply": "4.75\u202629V", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "Step/Dir": "Yes", "UART": "Yes", "MicroPlyer\u2122": "Yes", "CoolStep\u2122": "Yes", "short detection": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "Stall detection": "Yes", "StealthChop2\u2122": "Yes", "StallGuard4\u2122": "Yes", "Phase Current, RMS": "2.0A", "Package": "QFN28 (5x5)"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Images/TMC2209-LA.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Blockdiagrams/TMC2209_Block_Diagram.svg", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Pinouts/TMC2209_Pinout.JPG"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Datasheet Rev 1.05", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC2209_Datasheet_V105.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["TMC2209 Calculations", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC2209_Calculations.xlsx"]], "Quality": [["Statement concerning RoHS compliance of TMC2209", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Company/Quality/RoHS_ICs/TMC2209_ROHS.pdf"]], "Additional Resources": [["Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)", "https://trinamic.comhttps://www.trinamic.com/support/faq/"], ["Application Programming Interface (API)", "https://trinamic.comhttps://www.trinamic.com/support/software/access-package/"]]}}
