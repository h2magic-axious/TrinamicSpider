{"model": "TMC457-BC", "excerpt": "The TMC457 is a stepper and piezo motor servo controller with S-shaped ramps for laboratory automation, 3D-Printing, Scanners and other automated equipment applications. The device is usable as a trapezoidal ramp generator. Furthermore the TMC457 is powered by Trinamic ChopSync\u2122 technology. The device is designed for an operating voltage of 1.5V and 3.3V. The TMC457 provides a SPI controller and SPI, S/D driver interface. Additionally it has an a/b/n incremental encoder interface.Special Featuresmicrostep table", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "1", "Motor Supply": "", "Microsteps": "1\u20262048", "a/b/n incremental": "Yes", "SPI": "Yes", "Step/Dir": "Yes", "advanced S-shaped": "Yes", "trapezoidal": "Yes", "microstep table": "Yes", "Phase Current, RMS": "", "Package": "FBGA144 (13x13)"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Images/Tmc457-BC.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Blockdiagrams/TMC457-BC-V2.svg"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Datasheet Rev 1.20", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC457_datasheet_rev1.20.pdf"]], "Application Notes": [["AN 005b - PCB Footprint Guidelines FBGA144", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/AN005b-IC_Package_PCB_Footprint_Guidelines_FBGA144.pdf"], ["AN 013 - Motion Control Profile Parameterization", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Appnotes/AN013-Motion_control_profile_parametrization.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["Calculation Sheet", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/tmc457_calculations.xls"]], "Quality": [["Statement concerning RoHS compliance of TMC457", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Company/Quality/RoHS_ICs/TMC457_RoHS.pdf"]], "Additional Resources": [["Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)", "https://trinamic.comhttps://www.trinamic.com/support/faq/"], ["Application Programming Interface (API)", "https://trinamic.comhttps://www.trinamic.com/support/software/access-package/"]]}}
