{"model": "TMC8461-BA", "excerpt": "The TMC8461 is a complete EtherCAT\u00ae Slave Controller optimized for real time. It comprises all blocks required for an EtherCAT slave including two switch regulator power supplies and 35V capable high voltage I/Os for industrial environments. Timer, watchdog, PWM and SPI/ IIC master units allow for enhanced capabilities either in device emulation mode or in combination with an external CPU.The TMC8461 can also be used in combination with EtherCAT P, allowing for both data and power to be supplied using one single cable.
