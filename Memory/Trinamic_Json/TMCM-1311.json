{"model": "TMCM-1311", "excerpt": "The TMCM-1311 is a fully closed single axis stepper control unit for all applications that require high reliability and dynamics. The device is powered by Trinamic StallGuard2\u2122, CoolStep\u2122 and SpreadCycle\u2122 chopper technology. The TMCM-1311 is capable of driving up to 4.3A of current from each output (with proper heatsinking). It is designed for an operating voltage of 9...51V. The device provides a RS485, CAN, USB and encoder interface. An integrated protocol processor supplies a high level TMCL communication.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data.More about the TMCL-IDESpecial Featuresmicrostep tableStallGuard2\u2122CoolStep\u2122SpreadCycle\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "1", "Motor Supply": "10\u202652.5V", "Phase Current, RMS": "3.0A", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "a/b/n incremental": "Yes", "CAN": "Yes", "RS485": "Yes", "Step/Dir": "Yes", "USB": "Yes", "TMCL\u2122": "Yes", "trapezoidal": "Yes", "microstep table": "Yes", "StallGuard2\u2122": "Yes", "CoolStep\u2122": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "Width": "110mm", "Length": "110mm", "Height": "27mm"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Images/TMCM-1311.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Blockdiagrams/TMCM-1311.svg"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Hardware Manual Rev 1.12", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1311_hardware_manual_hw1.2_rev1.12.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["Setup Information", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1311.inf"], ["TMCL Firmware Manual FW V1.14 Rev 1.18", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1311-TMCL_firmware_manual_fw1.14_rev1.18.pdf"], ["CE Conformity", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/2016_05_02_TMCM-1311_CE_Conformity.pdf"]], "Software": [["Setup Information (Trinamic_inf_cat)", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Software/Trinamic_inf_cat.zip"], ["TMCL Firmware V1.14", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1311_TMCL_V114.zip"], ["TMCL Firmware V1.11", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1311_V111.hex"], ["TMCL Firmware V1.07", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1311_V107.hex"], ["TMCM-131x Tool", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-131X.zip"]], "PCNs": [["PCN_TMCM-1311_2014-06-16", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/PCN_TMCM-1311_2014-06-16_V100.pdf"]]}}
