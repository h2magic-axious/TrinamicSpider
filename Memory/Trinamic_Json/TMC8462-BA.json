{"model": "TMC8462-BA", "excerpt": "The TMC8462 is an EtherCAT slave controller with multifunction I/Os (8 high voltage) and a dual switching regulator power supply for industrial automation, robotics and other automated equipment applications. The device is suitable as a step/ direction output, SPI master and I\u00b2C master. The TMC8462 includes two Ethernet PHYs and directly connects to the physical medium. The device provides an a/b/n incremental, IIC, PWM, SPI interface. The TMC8462 is designed for an operating voltage of 3.3V or 5...35V.The TMC8462 can also be used in combination with EtherCAT P, allowing for both data and power to be supplied using one single cable.
