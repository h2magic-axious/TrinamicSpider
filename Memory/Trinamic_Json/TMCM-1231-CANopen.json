{"model": "TMCM-1231-CANopen", "excerpt": "The TMCM-1231 is a single axis controller/driver module for 2-phase bipolar stepper motors. The module can either be used with TMCL firmware supporting standalone operation as well as direct mode control using TMCL\u2122 commands or with CANopen firmware supporting control using the CANopen protocol. Both firmware versions make extensive use of the Trinamic TMC4361 motion controller and TMC5160 motor driver. Dynamic current control, and quiet, smooth and ecient operation are combined with StealthChop\u2122, DcStep\u2122, StallGuard2\u2122 and CoolStep\u2122 features.Special FeaturesDcStep\u2122ChopSync\u2122CoolStep\u2122passive brakingshort detectionSpreadCycle\u2122Stall detectionStallGuard2\u2122StealthChop2\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "1", "Motor Supply": "10\u202652V", "Phase Current, RMS": "6.5A", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "a/b/n incremental": "Yes", "CAN": "Yes", "RS485": "Yes", "Step/Dir": "Yes", "GPIO": "Yes", "TMCL\u2122": "", "CANopen": "Yes", "advanced S-shaped": "Yes", "SixPoint\u2122": "Yes", "trapezoidal": "Yes", "DcStep\u2122": "Yes", "ChopSync\u2122": "Yes", "CoolStep\u2122": "Yes", "passive braking": "Yes", "short detection": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "Stall detection": "Yes", "StallGuard2\u2122": "Yes", "StealthChop2\u2122": "Yes", "Width": "45mm", "Length": "80mm", "Height": "7mm"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Images/TMCM-1231.jpg", "images": null, "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Hardware Manual", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1231_hardware_manual_Hw1.1_Rev1.01.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["TMCL Firmware Manual for Firmware V1.16", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1231_TMCL_firmware_manual_Fw1.16_Rev1.00.pdf"], ["CANopen Firmware Manual for Firmware V3.25", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1231_CANopen_firmware_manual_Fw3.25_Rev1.00.pdf"]], "Software": [["TMCL Firmware V1.16", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1231_TMCL_V116.hex"], ["CANopen Firmware V3.25", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1231_CANopen_V325.zip"]], "Drawings": [["STEP File V1.1", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Drawings/TMCM-1231_V11.step"]]}}
