{"model": "TMCM-102", "excerpt": "The TMCM-102 is a single axis 2-phase stepper motor controller and driver module with an aluminium profile for quick and robust mounting. The built in encoder feedback makes it an optimum solution for high-reliability drives. This drive is optimally suited for industrial high-reliability applications. The power stage has very low dissipation when compared to competitors' products. Its interface add-on board concept allows for customer specific interface / connector selection. The TMCM-102 comes with the PC based software development environment TMCL-IDE for the Trinamic Motion Control Language (TMCL\u2122). Using predefined TMCL\u2122 high level commands like \"move to position\" or \"constant rotation\" rapid and fast development of motion control applications is guaranteed. Communication traffic is kept very low since all time critical operations, e.g. ramp calculation, are performed on board. The TMCL program can be stored in the on-board EEPROM for stand-alone operation. The firmware of the module can be updated via the serial interface. With the StallGuard\u2122 feature it is possible to detect motor overload or motor stall.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data.More about the TMCL-IDESpecial FeaturesStallGuard\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "1", "Motor Supply": "18\u202655V", "Phase Current, RMS": "3.5A", "Microsteps": "1\u202664", "a/b/n incremental": "Yes", "CAN": "Yes", "RS232": "Yes", "RS422": "Yes", "RS485": "Yes", "USB": "Yes", "TMCL\u2122": "Yes", "trapezoidal": "Yes", "StallGuard\u2122": "Yes", "Width": "70mm", "Length": "76mm", "Height": "30mm"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Images/TMCM-102-IF_white_cm_300dpi.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Blockdiagrams/TMCM-102_Block_Diagram.svg"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Hardware Manual V1.02", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-102_manual.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["TMCM-IF Manual", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-IF_manual.pdf"], ["TMCL Reference Manual", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCL_reference.pdf"]], "Software": [["USB", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM102_USB.zip"], ["TMCL Firmware V6.35", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM102_V635.hex"], ["TMCL Firmware V6.34", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM102_V634.hex"]]}}
