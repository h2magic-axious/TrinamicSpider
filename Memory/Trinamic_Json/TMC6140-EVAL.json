{"model": "TMC6140-EVAL", "excerpt": "The TMC6140-EVAL allows evaluation of the TMC6140 in combination with the TRINAMIC evaluation board system, or as a\u00a0stand-alone-board. It uses the standard schematic and offers several options in order to test different modes of operation.The TMC6140-EVAL-KIT is a set of one MCU board\u00a0Landungsbr\u00fccke, one\u00a0Eselsbr\u00fccke\u00a0bridge board and one TMC6140-EVAL driver board. It allows for a quick and simple start within only minutes to make your motor turning.For diagnosis, all signals between MCU and TMC6140\u00a0are accessible with probes on the bridge board. TMC6140-EVAL can be used with or without the Landungsbr\u00fccke\u00a0MCU board. Compehensive sample code can be found in Trinamics Technology Access Package\u00a0TTAP.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data. All settings can simply be exported for your own firmware project.More about the TMCL-IDE", "fields": {"Status": "Preview", "Motor Supply": "6\u202630V", "Phase Current, RMS": "32.0A", "Microsteps": "", "PWM": "Yes"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Images/TMC6140-EVAL.jpg", "images": null, "resource": {"Documentation": [["TMC6140-EVAL Manual", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Documents/TMC6140-EVAL_user_manual_Rev1.00.pdf"]]}}
