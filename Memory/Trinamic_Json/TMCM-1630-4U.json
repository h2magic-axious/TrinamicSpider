{"model": "TMCM-1630-4U", "excerpt": "The TMCM-1630 is a compact single axis controller/ driver module for brushless DC motor applications. The device can deliver up-to 14A peak per motor phase (with proper heatsinking) and a continuous output power of 150...300W. The TMCM-1630 is made for supply voltages of 15...48V. Depending on the commutation mode the TMCM-1630 works with velocity and/or position control. The module can be used in standalone operation or remote controlled via serial interface RS232,CAN or optional with RS485 / USB using the Trinamic Motion Control Language TMCL.The TMCM-1630 is compatible with Trinamic's baseboard BB-163x.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data.More about the TMCL-IDESpecial Featuresbreak before makeshort detectionslope controlCurrent Sense", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "1", "Motor Supply": "14.5\u202655V", "Phase Current, RMS": "10.0A", "a/b/n incremental": "Yes", "CAN": "", "RS232": "", "Digital Hall": "Yes", "RS485": "Yes", "USB": "Yes", "TMCL\u2122": "Yes", "trapezoidal": "Yes", "break before make": "Yes", "short detection": "Yes", "slope control": "Yes", "Current Sense": "Yes", "Width": "92mm", "Length": "50mm", "Height": "14mm"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Images/TMCM-1630-TMCL.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Blockdiagrams/TMCM-1630.svg"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Hardware Manual Rev 1.06", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1630_hardware_manual_hw1.1_rev1.06.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["TMCL Firmware Manual FW V2.09 Rev 2.06", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1630-TMCL_firmware_manual_fw2.09_rev2.06.pdf"], ["TMCL Firmware Manual FW V2.08 Rev 2.04", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1630-TMCL_firmware_manual_fw2.08_rev2.04.pdf"], ["Setup information", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1630.inf"], ["Sample TMCL Scripts V2.09", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1630_sample_tmcl_scripts_v2.09.zip"], ["Sample TMCL Scripts V2.08", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1630_sample_tmcl_scripts_v2.08.zip"]], "Software": [["Firmware V2.09", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1630_TMCL_Hw1.10-Fw2.09.hex"], ["Firmware V2.08", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1630-FOC_v2.08.hex"], ["Firmware V2.07", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1630-FOC_v2.07.hex"], ["Firmware V2.05", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1630-FOC_v2.05.hex"]], "PCNs": [["PCN-2018-03-03 Firmware V2.09", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/PCN_2018-03-03_Firmware_V209.pdf"]], "Drawings": [["STEP-File V2.0", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Drawings/TMCM-1630_v2.step"]]}}
