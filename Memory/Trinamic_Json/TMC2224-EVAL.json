{"model": "TMC2224-EVAL", "excerpt": "The TMC2224-EVAL allows you to explore all functions of the TMC2224-LA.The TMC2224-EVAL-KIT is a set of one MCU board Landungsbr\u00fccke, a TMC22xx bridge board and one TMC2224-EVAL driver board. It allows for a quick and simple start within only minutes to make your motor turning, while still providing full access to all registers and full functionality and diagnostics.For diagnosis, all signals between MCU and TMC2224 are accessible with probes on the bridge board. TMC2224-EVAL can be used with or without the Landungsbr\u00fccke\u00a0MCU board. Compehensive sample code can be found in Trinamics Technology Access Package TTAP.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data. All settings can simply be exported for your own firmware project.More about the TMCL-IDESpecial FeaturesMicroPlyer\u2122SpreadCycle\u2122StealthChop2\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Motor Supply": "4.75\u202636V", "Phase Current, RMS": "1.35A", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "Step/Dir": "Yes", "UART": "Yes", "MicroPlyer\u2122": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "StealthChop2\u2122": "Yes"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Images/TMC2224-EVAL.jpg", "images": null, "resource": {"Datasheet": [["TMC2224 Datasheet", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC220x_TMC2224_Datasheet_Rev1.10.pdf"]], "Drawings": [["TMC2224-EVAL CAD Files V1.1", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Drawings/TMC2224-Eval-CAD_Files_V1.1.ZIP"], ["TMC2224-EVAL Layout Data (PDF) V1.1", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Drawings/TMC2224-Eval_Layout.zip"], ["TMC22xx-Bridge Schematic V1.1", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Drawings/TMC22xx-Bridge_v11_01_Schematic.pdf"], ["TMC22xx-Bridge EAGLE Files V1.1", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Drawings/TMC2208-Bridge_v11_EAGLE_files.ZIP"]]}}
