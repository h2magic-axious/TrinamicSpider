{"model": "PD42-2-1370-TMCL", "excerpt": "The PD42-x-1370 family\u00a0features small and compact full mechatronic solutions including NEMA17 / 42mm flange size stepper motors. The PANdrives\u2122 are controlled via RS485 bus interface using TMCL protocol.With its built-in high resolution encoder, the PD42-x-1370 is mainly designed for closed-loop operation, but also features an integrated magnetic encoder for position feedback, SpreadCycle\u2122 chopper for high speed stepper motor commutation, a fully integrated hardware motion controller with s-shaped motion ramps, as well as StallGuard2\u2122 and CoolStep\u2122.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data.More about the TMCL-IDESpecial Featuresclosed loop controlCoolStep\u2122SpreadCycle\u2122StallGuard2\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Flange NEMA": "17", "Flange": "42mm", "Holding Torque": "36Ncm", "Motor Supply": "9\u202628V", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "RS485": "Yes", "TMCL\u2122": "Yes", "closed loop control": "Yes", "S-shaped": "Yes", "CoolStep\u2122": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "StallGuard2\u2122": "Yes", "Width": "42mm", "Height": "42mm", "Length": "51mm"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Images/PD42-2-1370.jpg", "images": null, "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Hardware Manual Rev 1.11", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Documents/PD-1370_hardware_manual_fw1.10_rev1.11.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["TMCL Firmware Manual FW V1.37 Rev 1.05", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Documents/PD-1370-TMCL_firmware_manual_fw1.37_rev1.05_01.pdf"]], "Software": [["TMCL Firmware V1.35", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Software/TMCM-1370_V135_200FS.hex"]], "Drawings": [["PD42-1-1370 STEP-File", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Drawings/PD42-1-1370.STEP"], ["PD42-2-1370 STEP-File", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Drawings/PD42-2-1370.STEP"], ["PD42-3-1370 STEP-File", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Drawings/PD42-3-1370.STEP"], ["PD42-4-1370 STEP-File", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Drawings/PD42-4-1370.STEP"]]}}
