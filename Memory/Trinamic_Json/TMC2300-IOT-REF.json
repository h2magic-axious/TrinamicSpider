{"model": "TMC2300-IOT-REF", "excerpt": "The TMC2300-IOT-REF is a completely open-source reference design for easy evaluation of the TMC2300-LA stepper motor driver IC. Whether it\u2019s a POS device, toys, office and home automation, or mobile medical devices, Engineers can quickly prototype their IoT applications running on 3.5 \u2013 6 V batteries. Besides the low-voltage stepper motor driver, the board features a Li-Ion cell charger via USB-C, a processor with integrated WiFi and BLE capabilities, as well as UART and USB-C for serial communication and programming. Other features including StealthChop2\u2122, StallGuard4\u2122 and CoolStep\u2122 bring industrial-grade solutions to convenient, handheld devices.Special FeaturesMicroPlyer\u2122CoolStep\u2122Stall detectionStealthChop2\u2122StallGuard4\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "preview", "Motor Supply": "3.5\u20266V", "Phase Current, RMS": "1.0A", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "UART": "Yes", "USB": "Yes", "MicroPlyer\u2122": "Yes", "CoolStep\u2122": "Yes", "Stall detection": "Yes", "StealthChop2\u2122": "Yes", "StallGuard4\u2122": "Yes"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Images/TMC2300-IOT-REF.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Images/TMC2300-IOT-REF_Block_Diagram_new.svg"], "resource": {"Documentation": [["TMC2300-IOT-REF Hardware Manual", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Documents/TMC2300-IOT-REF_hardware_manual_hw4.0_rev1.2.pdf"]], "Datasheet": [["TMC2300 Datasheet", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC2300_Datasheet_V104.pdf"]], "Drawings": [["TMC2300-IOT-REF ECAD Files V4.0", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Drawings/ECAD_TMC2300-IOT-REF_V40.ZIP"]]}}
