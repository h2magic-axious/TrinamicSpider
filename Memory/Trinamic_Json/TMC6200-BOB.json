{"model": "TMC6200-BOB", "excerpt": "The TMC6200 breakout board is a development board with the dedicated TMC6200-TA chip. It is designed to give users the chance to rapidly prototype their applications - making it possible to immediately check how the motor performs with TMC chips while developing the application's software.Further information on the chip:\u00a0The TMC6200 is a high-power gate driver for PMSM servo or BLDC motors. Using six external MOSFETs and two or three sense resistors, it integrates the full high voltage part of a FOC drive system for 12V, 24V or 48V, including in-line current sense amplifiers with programmable amplification. It can drive a wide range of motors from Watt to Kilowatt. Software controlled drive strength allows in-system EME optimization. Programmable safety features like short detection and overtemperature thresholds together with an SPI interface for diagnostics allow robust and reliable designs. With the TMC6200, a minimum number of external components is required to build a rugged drive with full protection and diagnostics.\u00a0\u00a0Special Featuresbreak before make", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Motor Supply": "8\u202660V", "Phase Current, RMS": "", "Microsteps": "", "PWM": "Yes", "SPI": "Yes", "break before make": "Yes"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Images/TMC6200-BOB.jpg", "images": null, "resource": {"Datasheet": [["TMC6200 Datasheet", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC6200_datasheet_Rev1.06.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["User Manual Rev 1.00", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Documents/TMC6200-BOB_datasheet_rev1.00.pdf"], ["TMC6200-BOB BOM V1.1", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Documents/TMC6200-BOB_V11_-_BOM.xlsx"]], "Drawings": [["CAD Files V1.1", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Drawings/TMC6200-BOB_CAD_Files_V1.1.zip"], ["Fabrication Data V1.1", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Drawings/TMC6200-BOB_Fabrication_Data_V1.1.zip"], ["Layout Data (PDF) V1.1", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Drawings/TMC6200-BOB_Layout_Data_V1.1.zip"]]}}
