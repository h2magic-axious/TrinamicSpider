{"model": "TMC236B-PA", "excerpt": "The TMC236 provides an integrated motor driver solution for Laboratory Automation, Scanners and other automated equipment applications. The device has an integrated microstepping current control and is intended to drive a bipolar stepper motor. The output driver block consists of low RDSon TrenchFET power MOSFETs configured as full H-bridges to drive the motor windings. The TMC236 is capable of driving up to 1.5A of current from each output (with proper heatsinking). TMC236 is designed for a supply voltage of 7...34V. The device has a SPI interface for control and diagnostics.", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "1", "Motor Supply": "7\u202634V", "Microsteps": "1\u202664", "SPI": "Yes", "Phase Current, RMS": "1.1A", "Package": "LQFP44 (10x10)"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Images/tmc236.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Blockdiagrams/TMC236-V2.svg", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Pinouts/TMC236.svg"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Datasheet Rev 2.11", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC236_datasheet_rev2.11.pdf"]], "Software": [["Example", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/tmc236_example.c"], ["Software Examples_TMC23x_24x", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Software/Software_Examples_TMC23x_24x.zip"]], "Documentation": [["Power dissipation calculation", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/Calc_PowerDissipation.xls"]], "Application Notes": [["AN 005d - PCB Footprint Guidelines LQFP44", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/AN005d-IC_Package_PCB_Footprint_Guidelines_LQFP44.pdf"], ["AN 042 - FAQs TMC236, TMC246, TMC239, TMC249", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Appnotes/AN042-TMC236_246_239_249_FAQ.PDF"], ["AN 044 - Replacing the TMC236/TMC246 by the TMC260 or TMC261", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Appnotes/AN044-Replacing_the_TMC236_or_TMC246_by_the_TMC260_or_TMC261_in_an_existing_project.pdf"]], "Quality": [["Statement concerning RoHS compliance of TMC236", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Company/Quality/RoHS_ICs/TMC236_RoHS.pdf"]], "PCNs": [["PCN 2016-06-03 TMC236", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/EOL_PCN/PCN_2016-06-03_TMC236A-PA.pdf"], ["PCN 2013-07-25 TMC236", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/EOL_PCN/2013_07_25_2_pcn_tmc236_tmc246.pdf"]], "Additional Resources": [["Application Programming Interface (API)", "https://trinamic.comhttps://www.trinamic.com/support/software/access-package/"], ["Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)", "https://trinamic.comhttps://www.trinamic.com/support/faq/"]]}}
