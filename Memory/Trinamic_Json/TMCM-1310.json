{"model": "TMCM-1310", "excerpt": "The TMCM-1310 is a fully closed single axis stepper control unit for all applications that require high reliability and dynamics. The device is powered by Trinamic StallGuard2\u2122, CoolStep\u2122 and SpreadCycle\u2122 chopper technology. The TMCM-1310 is capable of driving up to 4.3A of current from each output (with proper heatsinking). It is designed for an operating voltage of 9...51V. The device provides an USB, EtherCAT and encoder interface. An integrated protocol processor supplies a high level CANopen over EtherCAT communication.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data.More about the TMCL-IDESpecial Featuresmicrostep tableStallGuard2\u2122CoolStep\u2122SpreadCycle\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "1", "Motor Supply": "9\u202651V", "Phase Current, RMS": "3.0A", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "a/b/n incremental": "Yes", "EtherCAT\u00ae": "Yes", "USB": "Yes", "CoE": "Yes", "trapezoidal": "Yes", "microstep table": "Yes", "StallGuard2\u2122": "Yes", "CoolStep\u2122": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "Width": "110mm", "Length": "110mm", "Height": "27mm"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Images/TMCM-1310.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Blockdiagrams/TMCM-1310.svg"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Hardware Manual Rev 1.12", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1310_hardware_manual_hw1.2_rev1.12.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["TMCL Firmware Manual FW V1.14 Rev 1.17", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1310-TMCL_firmware_manual_fw1.14_rev1.17.pdf"], ["TMCL Firmware Manual FW V1.11 Rev 1.16", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1310_TMCL_firmware_manual.pdf"], ["CoE Firmware Manual FW V2.07 Rev 1.03", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1310_CoE_firmware_manual_fw2.07_rev1.03.pdf"], ["CE Conformity", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/2016_05_02_TMCM-1310_CE_Conformity.pdf"]], "Software": [["Setup Information (Trinamic_inf_cat)", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Software/Trinamic_inf_cat.zip"], ["TMCL Firmware V1.14", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1310_TMCL_V114.zip"], ["TMCL Firmware V1.11", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1310_V111.hex"], ["TMCL Firmware V1.07", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1310_1.07.zip"], ["CoE Firmware V2.06", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1310_CoE_FOC_V206.zip"], ["TMCM-131X Tool", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-131X.zip"]]}}
