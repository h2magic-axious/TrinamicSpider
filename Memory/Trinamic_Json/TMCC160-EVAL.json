{"model": "TMCC160-EVAL", "excerpt": "TMCC160-EVAL is both a reference design and an evaluation platform for TMCC160-LC MotionCookie\u2122 integrated servo controller microsystem. The board can be used standalone.TMCC160-EVAL can also be combined with TMC8460-EVAL as an EtherCAT based Servo Controller.For diagnosis, all signals are accessible with probes on the Eselsbr\u00fccke connector.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data. All settings can simply be exported for your own firmware project.More about the TMCL-IDE", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Motor Supply": "7\u202624V", "Phase Current, RMS": "10.0A", "Microsteps": "", "a/b/n incremental": "Yes", "Analog Hall": "Yes", "CAN": "Yes", "RS232": "Yes", "RS485": "Yes"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Images/TMCC160-EVAL.jpg", "images": null, "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Datasheet Rev 1.00", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMCC160_datasheet_rev1.00.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["Hardware Manual HW V1.10 Rev 1.02", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Documents/TMCC160-EVAL_user_manual_hw1.10_rev1.02.pdf"], ["Firmware Manual FW V2.11 Rev 1.01", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMCC160_TMCL_firmware_manual_fw2.11_rev1.01.pdf"], ["Firmware Manual FW V2.09 Rev 1.00", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Documents/TMCC160_firmware_manual.pdf"], ["TMCC160 BOM V12", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Documents/TMCC160-EVAL_V12_BOM.xlsx"]], "Drawings": [["EAGLE Files V1.2", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Drawings/TMCC160-EVAL_V12_Eagle-files.zip"], ["Layout Data (PDF) V1.2", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Drawings/TMCC160-EVAL-Layout_Data_V1.2.zip"]], "Software": [["TMCL Firmware V2.11", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Software/TMCC160_TMCL_Hw1.00_Fw2.11.hex"], ["TMCL Firmware V2.09", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Software/TMCC160_HW_v1.0_FW_v2.09.hex"], ["Sample TMCL scripts V2.11", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Software/TMCC160_sample_tmcl_scripts_v2.11.zip"], ["Sample TMCL scripts V2.09", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Software/TMCC160_sample_tmcl_scripts_v2.09.zip"], ["TMCC160 - CoE EDS", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Software/TMCC160-CoE_Hw1.00_Fw4.01.xml"]], "Application Notes": [["Application Note 055 - How to run TMCC160 and TMC8462 with TwinCAT3", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Appnotes/AN055-How_to_run_TMCC160_and_TMC8462_with_TwinCAT3.pdf"], ["Application Note 055 - How to run TMCC160 and TMC8462 with TwinCAT3 (Chinese Version)", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Appnotes/AN055-How_to_run_TMCC160_and_TMC8462_with_TwinCAT3_CN.pdf"]]}}
