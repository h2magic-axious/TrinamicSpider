{"model": "TMCS-28-5-10000-AT-01", "excerpt": "With their exceptional low speed performance stepper motors are often a good choice where a servo is required but a gearbox for some reason is not beneficial. With their high pole count stepper motors servos work better with high resolution encoders.\u00a0TMCS-28 is a low-cost and small-size optical incremental encoder for use with stepper motors and 3-phase PMSM/BLDC motors. It comes with high resolution optical code wheels with a resolution of up to 10K lines.The shaft diameter of TMCS-28-6.35-10000 and TMSC-28-6.35-1024 is 6.35 mm.", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Resolution": "40000 increments", "Hollow Diameter": "5mm", "Housing Diameter": "28mm", "Level": "TTL", "a/b/n incremental": "Yes"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Encoder_Images/TMCS-28.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Encoder_Images/TMCS-BD.png"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Datasheet Rev 1.60", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Encoder_Documents/TMCS-28_hardware_manual_hw1.00_rev1.60.pdf"]], "Drawings": [["TMCS-28 3D File", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Encoder_Drawings/TMCS-28.STEP"]], "Application Notes": [["Application Note 050 - TMCS-XX Encoder Mounting Manual", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Appnotes/AN050_-_TMCS-XX_Mounting_Manual.pdf"]]}}
