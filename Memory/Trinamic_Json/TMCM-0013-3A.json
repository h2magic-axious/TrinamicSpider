{"model": "TMCM-0013-3A", "excerpt": "The TMCM-0013-xA boards are tools to simplify measurement and visualization of motor phase currents for stepper motors, BLDC motors, or DC motors of 2A, 3A, or 6A. With this little tool, expensive current probes are no longer needed. Simply connect the board to typical laboratory oscilloscopes to read out 2 phase currents of the motor.\u00a0Please note that while the current sense board looks like an evaluation board, it can be used with any module from Trinamic or even modules from other companies.", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "1", "Motor Supply": "7\u202635V", "Width": "85mm", "Length": "55mm", "Height": "24mm"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Images/Current_Sense_Board_3A.jpg", "images": null, "resource": {"Documentation": [["Hardware Manual Rev 1.00", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-0013-xA_hardware_manual_rev1.00.pdf"]]}}
