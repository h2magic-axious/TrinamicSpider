{"model": "TMCM-0960-MotionPy", "excerpt": "The TMCM-0960-MotionPy board is an open-source single board computer running MicroPython. It comes with several communication interface options like CAN, RS485, UART, and separate GPIO headers. With a wide supply voltage range of +6...+50V and industrial Fieldbus interfaces it is the engineers\u2019 swiss army knife for small automation applications.Plugging directly into the application for logging data on an SD card or updating subsystems without the need for additional tools, the module offers a total of 13 functions in Python programming language for ease of use.", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "", "Motor Supply": "6\u202650V", "Phase Current, RMS": "", "Microsteps": "", "CAN": "Yes", "RS485": "Yes", "SPI": "Yes", "UART": "Yes", "USB": "Yes", "GPIO": "Yes", "Width": "55mm", "Length": "85mm", "Height": "20mm"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Images/TMCM-0960-MotionPy.jpg", "images": null, "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Hardware Manual", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Documents/TMCM-0960-MotionPy_HW_Manual_V10.pdf"]], "Software": [["TMCL Firmware V1.0", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Software/TMCM-0960-MotionPy_FW_V10.hex"]], "Drawings": [["ECAD Files V1.6", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Drawings/ECAD_TMCM-0960-MotionPy_V16.zip"], ["3D Model V1.6", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Drawings/3D-Model-TMCM-0960-MotionPy_V16.zip"]], "Additional Resources": [["PyTrinamic Python Library", "https://trinamic.comhttps://github.com/trinamic/PyTrinamic"]]}}
