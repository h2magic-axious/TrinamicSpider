{"model": "TMCM-3351-TMCL", "excerpt": "The TMCM-3351 is a three axes motor controller/driver board for 2-phase bipolar stepper motors. It is the direct successor of the TMCM-351 - mechanically and electrically compatible - with our latest generation of stepper driver and motion controller ICs supporting linear and S-shaped ramps and closed-loop operation with external ABN-encoders.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data.More about the TMCL-IDESpecial Featuresclosed loop controlDcStep\u2122ChopSync\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "3", "Motor Supply": "11\u202628V", "Phase Current, RMS": "3.0A", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "a/b/n incremental": "Yes", "CAN": "Yes", "RS232": "Yes", "RS485": "Yes", "SPI": "Yes", "USB": "Yes", "TMCL\u2122": "Yes", "CANopen": "", "closed loop control": "Yes", "DcStep\u2122": "Yes", "ChopSync\u2122": "Yes", "Width": "160mm", "Length": "100mm", "Height": "35mm"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Images/TMCM-3351.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Blockdiagrams/TMCM-3351_Blockdiagramm.svg"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Hardware Manual Rev 0.91", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-3351_hardware_manual_hw1.00_rev1.00.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["TMCL Firmware Manual FW V1.11 Rev 1.07", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-3351_TMCL_firmware_manual_Fw1.11_Rev1.07.pdf"], ["TMCL Firmware Manual FW V1.09 Rev 1.03", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-3351_TMCL_firmware_manual_Fw1.09_Rev1.03.pdf"], ["CANopen Firmware Manual FW V3.22 Rev 1.01", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-3351-CANopen_firmware_manual_fw3.22_rev1.01.pdf"], ["CANopen Firmware Manual FW V3.21 Rev 1.00", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-3351_CANopen-firmware_manual_Fw3.21_Rev1.00.pdf"]], "Drawings": [["STEP-File", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Drawings/TMCM-3351.step"]], "PCNs": [["PCN 2019-06-01 TMCL Firmware V1.11", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/PCN_2019-06-01_Firmware_V111_TMCL.pdf"], ["PCN 2019-06-03 CANopen Firmware V3.22", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/PCN_2019-06-03_Firmware_V322_CANopen.pdf"]], "Software": [["TMCL Firmware V1.11", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-3351_TMCL_V111.hex"], ["TMCL Firmware V1.09", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-3351_TMCL_V109.hex"], ["CANopen Firmware V3.22 (hex and EDS file)", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-3351_CANopen_V322.zip"], ["CANopen Firmware V3.21 (hex and EDS file)", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-3351_CANopen_V321.zip"]]}}
