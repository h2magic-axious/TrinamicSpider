{"model": "TMC5160A-TA", "excerpt": "The TMC5160 is a high power stepper motor controller and driver IC with serial communication interfaces. It combines a flexible ramp generator for automatic target positioning with industries\u2019 most advanced stepper motor driver. Using external transistors, highly dynamic, high torque drives can be realized. Based on Trinamic's sophisticated SpreadCycle\u2122 and StealthChop\u2122 choppers, the driver ensures absolutely noiseless operation combined with maximum efficiency and best motor torque. High integration, high energy efficiency and a small form factor enable miniaturized and scalable systems for cost effective solutions. The complete solution reduces learning curve to a minimum while giving best performance in class. TMC5160-WA uses a wettable flank package to allow optical inspection of the soldering joints.Special FeaturesMicroPlyer\u2122CoolStep\u2122passive brakingshort detectionSpreadCycle\u2122Stall detectionStallGuard2\u2122StealthChop2\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "1", "Motor Supply": "8\u202660V", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "a/b/n incremental": "Yes", "SPI": "Yes", "Step/Dir": "Yes", "UART": "Yes", "SixPoint\u2122": "Yes", "trapezoidal": "Yes", "MicroPlyer\u2122": "Yes", "CoolStep\u2122": "Yes", "passive braking": "Yes", "short detection": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "Stall detection": "Yes", "StallGuard2\u2122": "Yes", "StealthChop2\u2122": "Yes", "Package": "eTQFP48 (7x7)"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Images/TMC5160A-TA.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Blockdiagrams/TMC5160_Block_Diagram.svg"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Datasheet Rev 1.14", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC5160A_Datasheet_Rev1.14.pdf"], ["Datasheet Rev 1.13 (Chinese)", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC5160A_Datasheet_Rev1_13_CN.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["Calculation Sheet", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC5160_Calculations.xlsx"]], "Software": [["UART-CRC-Calculator", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Software/UART-CRC-calculator.zip"]], "Application Notes": [["AN 028 - Extending Positioning Range TMC5xxx", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Appnotes/AN028-Extending_the_positioning_range_of_TMC5XXX.pdf"], ["AN 005a - PCB Footprint Guidelines eTQFP48", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/AN005a-IC_Package_PCB_Footprint_Guidelines_eTQFP48.pdf"]], "Quality": [["Statement concerning RoHS compliance of TMC5160", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Company/Quality/RoHS_ICs/TMC5160_RoHS.pdf"]], "PCNs": [["PCN 2019-08-02 Hardware Change TMCx160A", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/EOL_PCN/PCN-2019-08-02_TMCx160A.pdf"]], "Additional Resources": [["Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)", "https://trinamic.comhttps://www.trinamic.com/support/faq/"], ["Application Programming Interface (API)", "https://trinamic.comhttps://www.trinamic.com/support/software/access-package/"]]}}
