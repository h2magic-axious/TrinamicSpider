The interface converter is based on the FTDI FT4222H USB High-Speed to SPI bridge. It is USB bus powered and offers basic ESD protection. USB-2-RTMI comes with connections cables for the RTMI connector and Micro USB.Please note that USB-2-RTMI V2.0 version includes galvanic isolation between USB and RTMI connector. This device will work with the latest TMC4671-LA FOC controller IC but not with the previous version TMC4671-ES.It offers the same tiny 10pin connector with same pin assignment for the RTMI interface as it can be found on the TMC4671-LA line of evaluation boards.", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "", "Motor Supply": "", "Phase Current, RMS": "", "Microsteps": "", "USB": "Yes", "RTMI": "Yes", "Width": "40mm", "Length": "20mm", "Height": "7mm"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Images/USB-2-RTMI_V20.jpg", "images": null, "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Manual V2.00", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Documents/USB-2-RTMI_v200.pdf"], ["Manual V1.20", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/USB-2-RTMI_v120.pdf"]], "Application Notes": [["AN053 - TMC4671 PI Tuning", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Appnotes/AN053_TMC4671-PI_Tuning.pdf"]]}}
