{"model": "TMCM-1141", "excerpt": "The TMCM-1141 is a single axis stepper motor controller/driver module for sensorless load dependent current control. The device is powered by Trinamic StallGuard2\u2122, CoolStep\u2122 and SpreadCycle\u2122 chopper technology and has a trapezoidal ramp generator. The TMCM-1141 has been designed for coil currents up to 1.1A RMS (low current range, programmable) or 2.0A RMS (high current range, programmable with new additional range since hardware version 1.3). It is designed for an operating voltage of 9...28V. The device provides a RS485, USB, S/D interface. An integrated protocol processor supplies a high level TMCL communication.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data.More about the TMCL-IDESpecial FeaturesMicroPlyer\u2122StallGuard2\u2122CoolStep\u2122SpreadCycle\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "1", "Motor Supply": "9\u202628V", "Phase Current, RMS": "2.0A", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "RS485": "Yes", "Step/Dir": "Yes", "USB": "Yes", "TMCL\u2122": "Yes", "trapezoidal": "Yes", "MicroPlyer\u2122": "Yes", "StallGuard2\u2122": "Yes", "CoolStep\u2122": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "Width": "37mm", "Length": "37mm", "Height": "12mm"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Images/TMCM-1141.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Blockdiagrams/TMCM-1141_Block_Diagram.svg"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Hardware Manual Rev 1.06", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1141_hardware_manual_hw1.30_rev1.06.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["TMCL Firmware Manual Revision V1.10 for Firmware V1.42", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1141_TMCL-firmware_manual_Fw1.42_Rev1.10.pdf"], ["TMCL Firmware Manual Revision V1.09 for Firmware V1.42", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1141_TMCL_firmware_manual_Fw1.42_Rev1.09.pdf"], ["TMCL Firmware Manual Revision V1.07 for Firmware V1.42", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1141_TMCL-firmware_manual_V107.pdf"], ["TMCL Firmware Manual Revision V1.07 for Firmware V1.35", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1141_TMCL_firmware_V135__manual.pdf"], ["TMCL Firmware Manual Revision V1.03 for Firmware V1.24", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1141_TMCL_firmware_manual.pdf"]], "Software": [["Setup Information (Trinamic_inf_cat)", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Software/Trinamic_inf_cat.zip"], ["TMCL Firmware V1.42", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1141_V142.hex"], ["TMCL Firmware V1.35", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1141_V135.hex"], ["TMCL Firmware V1.24", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1141_V124.hex"], ["TMCL Firmware V1.21", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1141_V121.hex"], ["TMCL Firmware V1.20", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1141_V120.hex"]], "Drawings": [["STEP-File V1.3", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Drawings/TMCM-1141_V13.stp"]], "PCNs": [["PCN-2017-07-02 - Firmware 1.42", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/PCNs/PCN_2017-07-02_Firmware_V142.pdf"], ["PCN TMCM-1141", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/EOL_PCN/PCN_2016-01-03_TMCM-1141.pdf"]]}}
