{"model": "IDX 7505", "excerpt": "The IDX 7505 is a small and rugged step-/ direction stepper motor driver system with a supply voltage of up to 75V and up to 5A RMS motor coil current. The parameters of the IDX 7505 like motor current and \u00b5Step resolution can be changed easily using the RS-485 interface with an ASCII protocol (e.g. with Hyperterminal). Also the firmware of the module can be updated via the serial interface. All settings are stored in an internal EEPROM, so that no bus system is required in the application. The module is fully protected and comes with a stand-alone reference search feature, using the integrated reference switch input or StallGuard\u2122.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data.More about the TMCL-IDESpecial FeaturesStallGuard\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "1", "Motor Supply": "12\u202675V", "Phase Current, RMS": "5.0A", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "RS485": "Yes", "Step/Dir": "Yes", "StallGuard\u2122": "Yes", "Width": "64mm", "Length": "65mm", "Height": "24mm"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Images/IDX-7505.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Blockdiagrams/IDX.svg"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Hardware Manual Rev 1.17", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/IDX7505__hardware_manual_hw1.14_rev1.17.pdf.pdf"]], "Software": [["Firmware V1.17", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/IDX_V117.hex"], ["Firmware V1.15", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/IDX_V115.hex"], ["Firmware V1.14", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/IDX_V114.hex"], ["Boot.exe", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM013Boot.exe"]]}}
