{"model": "TMC-UPS-2A24V-EVAL", "excerpt": "TMC-UPS-2A24V-(A)-EVAL / TMC-UPS-10A70V-(A)-EVAL is a universal Power Stage.It drives up to 2A / 10A of current and is tolerant to supply voltages up to 24V / 70V. It uses half bridge gate drivers and discrete MOSFETs as well as standard connectors for supply and motor connection. Current measurement is implemented by inline shunt amplifiers.The Power Stages TMC-UPS-2A24V-A-EVAL and TMC-UPS-10A70V-A-EVAL (5V supply for shunt amplifiers) are optimized for usage with TMC4671-EVAL.The Power Stages TMC-UPS-2A24V-EVAL and TMC-UPS-10A70V-EVAL (3.3V supply for shunt amplifiers) are optimized for usage with TMC8670-EVAL.", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Motor Supply": "0\u202624V", "Phase Current, RMS": "2.0A", "PWM": "Yes", "SPI": "Yes", "Width": "85mm", "Length": "55mm", "Height": "15mm"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Images/TMC-UPS-2A-24V-EVAL.jpg", "images": null, "resource": {"Datasheet": [["TMC-UPS-2A24V-EVAL Manual Rev 1.20", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Documents/TMC-UPS-2A24V-EVAL_user_manual_hw1.10_rev1.20.pdf"], ["TMC-UPS-10A70V-EVAL Manual Rev 1.20", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Documents/TMC-UPS-10A70V-EVAL_user_manual_hw1.00_rev1.20.pdf"]], "Drawings": [["TMC-UPS-2A24V-EVAL Design Files", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Drawings/UPS_2A_EVAL_V11.zip"], ["TMC-UPS-10A70V-EVAL Design Files", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Drawings/UPS_10A_EVAL_V11.zip"], ["TMC-UPS-2A24V-A-EVAL Design Files", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Drawings/TMC-UPS-2A24V-A-EVAL_V10.zip"], ["TMC-UPS-10A70V-A-EVAL Design Files", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Drawings/TMC-UPS-10A70V-A-EVAL-V10.zip"]]}}
