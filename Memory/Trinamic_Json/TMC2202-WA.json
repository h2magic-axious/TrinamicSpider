{"model": "TMC2202-WA", "excerpt": "The TMC2202 provides an integrated motor driver solution for 3D-Printing, Cameras, Scanners and other automated equipment applications. The device has an integrated microstepping indexer, the completely noiseless current control mode StealthChop2\u2122 and is intended to drive a bipolar stepper motor. The output driver block consists of low RDSon N-Channel power MOSFETs configured as full H-bridges to drive the motor windings. The TMC2202 is capable of driving up to 2A of current from each output (with proper heatsinking). TMC2202 is designed for a supply voltage of 5...36V. The device has a step and direction interface and can be configured with digital pins.TMC2202-WA uses a wettable flank package to allow optical inspection of the soldering joints.Special FeaturesMicroPlyer\u2122SpreadCycle\u2122StealthChop2\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "1", "Motor Supply": "4.75\u202636V", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "Step/Dir": "Yes", "UART": "Yes", "MicroPlyer\u2122": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "StealthChop2\u2122": "Yes", "Phase Current, RMS": "1.4A", "Package": "QFN32 (5x5) wettable flank"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Images/TMC2202-WA.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Blockdiagrams/TMC2208-V2.svg", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Pinouts/TMC2202_Pinout.png"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Datasheet Rev 1.10", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC220x_TMC2224_Datasheet_Rev1.10.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["Calculation Sheet", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC220x_TMC222x_Calculations.xlsx"]], "Quality": [["Statement concerning RoHS compliance of TMC2202", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Company/Quality/RoHS_ICs/TMC2202_RoHS.pdf"]], "Software": [["UART-CRC-Calculator", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Software/UART-CRC-calculator.zip"]], "Application Notes": [["AN 005g - PCB Footprint Guidelines QFN32 5x5", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/AN005g-IC_Package_PCB_Footprint_Guidelines_QFN32_5x5.pdf"]], "Additional Resources": [["Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)", "https://trinamic.comhttps://www.trinamic.com/support/faq/"], ["Application Programming Interface (API)", "https://trinamic.comhttps://www.trinamic.com/support/software/access-package/"]]}}
