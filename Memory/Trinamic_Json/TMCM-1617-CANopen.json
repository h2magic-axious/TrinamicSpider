{"model": "TMCM-1617-CANopen", "excerpt": "The TMCM-1617 is a low-weight miniaturized single axis servo drive for 3-phase BLDC motors with up to 18A RMS motor current and +24V supply. With CAN, RS485, and EtherCAT\u00ae it o\ufb00ers various communication options. TMCM-1617 supports incremental encoders, analog encoders, and digital hall sensors as position feedback. Housing is included for the standard modules, but customization options are possible.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data.More about the TMCL-IDESpecial Featuresclosed loop controlFOCposition modevelocity modetorque mode", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "1", "Motor Supply": "8\u202628V", "Phase Current, RMS": "18.0A", "CAN": "Yes", "EtherCAT\u00ae": "", "RS485": "Yes", "CoE": "", "CANopen": "Yes", "TMCL\u2122": "", "closed loop control": "Yes", "FOC": "Yes", "position mode": "Yes", "velocity mode": "Yes", "torque mode": "Yes", "Width": "27mm", "Length": "37mm", "Height": "11mm"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Images/TMCM-1617.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Blockdiagrams/TMCM-1617_blockdiagram_01.svg"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Hardware Manual Rev 1.00", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1617_hardware_manual_hw1.2_rev1.00.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["TMCL Firmware Manual FW V1.06 Rev 1.00", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1617-TMCL_firmware_manual_fw1.06_rev1.00.pdf"], ["TMCL Sample Scripts V1.06", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1617-TMCL_sample_scripts_v1.06.zip"], ["CANopen Firmware Manual FW V1.06 Rev 1.00", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1617-CANopen_firmware_manual_fw1.06_rev1.00.pdf"], ["CoE Firmware Manual FW V1.06 Rev 1.00", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1617-CoE_firmware_manual_fw1.06_rev1.00.pdf"]], "Software": [["TMCL Firmware V1.06", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1617-TMCL_Hw1.2_Fw1.06.hex"], ["CANopen Firmware V1.06", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1617-CANopen_Hw1.2_Fw1.06.zip"], ["CoE Firmware V1.06", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1617-CoE_Hw1.2_Fw1.06.zip"]], "Drawings": [["STEP File", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Drawings/TMCM-1617_3DModel.STEP"], ["ECAD Files", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Drawings/TMCM-1617_ECAD.zip"]]}}
