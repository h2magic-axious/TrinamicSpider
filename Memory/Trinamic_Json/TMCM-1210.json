{"model": "TMCM-1210", "excerpt": "The TMCM-1210 is a single axis stepper motor controller/driver module with sensorless load dependent current control. The device is powered by Trinamic StallGuard2\u2122, CoolStep\u2122, SpreadCycle\u2122 chopper and StealthChop\u2122 technology and has a SixPoint\u2122 ramp generator. The TMCM-1210 is capable of driving up to 0.7A (RMS) of current per phase (with proper heatsinking). It is designed for an operating voltage of 7...30V. The device provides a RS485 interface. An integrated protocol processor supplies a high level TMCL communication.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data.More about the TMCL-IDESpecial FeaturesCoolStep\u2122SpreadCycle\u2122StallGuard2\u2122StealthChop\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "1", "Motor Supply": "7\u202630V", "Phase Current, RMS": "0.6A", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "RS485": "Yes", "TMCL\u2122": "Yes", "SixPoint\u2122": "Yes", "trapezoidal": "Yes", "CoolStep\u2122": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "StallGuard2\u2122": "Yes", "StealthChop\u2122": "Yes", "Width": "20mm", "Length": "20mm", "Height": "9mm"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Images/TMCM-1210.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Blockdiagrams/TMCM-1210_Block_Diagram.svg"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Hardware Manual Rev 0.93", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1210_hardware_manual_hw1.10_rev0.93.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["TMCL Firmware Manual FW V1.12 Rev 1.01", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1210-TMCL_firmware_manual_fw1.12_rev1.03.pdf"]], "Software": [["Firmware V1.12", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1210_V112.hex"]], "Drawings": [["TMCM-1210 STEP-File", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Drawings/TMCM-1210.step"]], "PCNs": [["PCN 2018-10-03 TMCL Firmware V1.12", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/PCN_2018-10-03_Firmware_V112.pdf"]]}}
