{"model": "PD42-3-1070", "excerpt": "PD-1070 is an easy to use PANdrive\u2122 smart stepper motor. The unit is controlled via a step and direction interface. One configuration pin selects the current control mode between StealthChop\u2122 for absolute silent motor control and SpreadCycle\u2122 for high speed. A TTL UART interface allows for more advanced configuration and permanent parameter storage via TMCL\u2122-IDE.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data.More about the TMCL-IDESpecial FeaturesMicroPlyer\u2122microstep tableCoolStep\u2122SpreadCycle\u2122StallGuard2\u2122StealthChop\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Flange NEMA": "17", "Flange": "42mm", "Holding Torque": "49Ncm", "Motor Supply": "9\u202624V", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "Step/Dir": "Yes", "UART": "Yes", "TMCL\u2122": "Yes", "MicroPlyer\u2122": "Yes", "microstep table": "Yes", "CoolStep\u2122": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "StallGuard2\u2122": "Yes", "StealthChop\u2122": "Yes", "Width": "42mm", "Height": "42mm", "Length": "51mm"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Images/PD42-3-1070.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Blockdiagrams/TMCM-1070.svg", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Blockdiagrams/TMCM-1070.svg"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Hardware Manual Rev 1.20", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Documents/PD-1070_hardware_manual_hw1.00_rev1.20_01.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["TMCL Firmware Manual FW V1.01 Rev 1.40", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Documents/PD-1070-TMCL_firmware_manual_fw1.01_rev1.40.pdf"]], "Drawings": [["PD42-1-1070 STEP-File", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Drawings/PD42-1-1070.STEP"], ["PD42-2-1070 STEP-File", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Drawings/PD42-2-1070.STEP"], ["PD42-3-1070 STEP-File", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Drives_Drawings/PD42-3-1070.STEP"]]}}
