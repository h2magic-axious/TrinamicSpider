{"model": "TMCM-1211 StepRocker", "excerpt": "The TMCM-1211 \"StepRocker\" is a single axis motor controller/driver board for 2-phase bipolar stepper motors. It features the TRINAMIC motion controller/motor driver TMC5160 in combination with an ARM Cortex-M4\u2122 (MK20DX128VLK7) processor. The module is intended to be a fully functional development platform.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data.More about the TMCL-IDESpecial FeaturesDcStep\u2122MicroPlyer\u2122CoolStep\u2122SpreadCycle\u2122StallGuard2\u2122StealthChop2\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "1", "Motor Supply": "10\u202630V", "Phase Current, RMS": "5.7A", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "a/b/n incremental": "Yes", "Analog Hall": "Yes", "RS485": "Yes", "Step/Dir": "Yes", "USB": "Yes", "GPIO": "Yes", "TMCL\u2122": "Yes", "SixPoint\u2122": "Yes", "DcStep\u2122": "Yes", "MicroPlyer\u2122": "Yes", "CoolStep\u2122": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "StallGuard2\u2122": "Yes", "StealthChop2\u2122": "Yes", "Width": "55mm", "Length": "85mm", "Height": "15mm"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Images/TMCM-1211.jpg", "images": null, "resource": {"Datasheet": [["TMCM-1211 Hardware Manual", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1211_hardware_manual_Hw1.10_Rev1.11.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["TMCM-1211 TMCL Firmware Manual FW V1.10 Rev 1.00", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1211_TMCL_firmware_manual_Hw1.10_Fw1.10_Rev1.00.pdf"], ["TMCM-1211 TMCL-LITE Firmware Manual FW V1.00 Rev 1.00", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1211-TMCL-LITE_firmware_manual_fw1.00_rev1.00.pdf"]], "Software": [["TMCM-1211 TMCL Firmware V1.10", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1211_TMCL_V110.hex"], ["TMCM-1211 TMCL-LITE Firmware V1.00", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCL-LITE-1211_V1.00.zip"]], "Drawings": [["TMCM-1211 STEP-File", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Drawings/TMCM-1211_V11.step"]]}}
