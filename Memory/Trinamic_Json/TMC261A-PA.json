{"model": "TMC261A-PA", "excerpt": "The TMC261 is the first energy efficient high current high precision microstepping driver IC for bipolar stepper motors. The unique high resolution sensorless load detection StallGuard2\u2122 is used to for the world\u2019s first integrated load dependent current control feature called CoolStep\u2122. The ability to read out the load and detect an overload makes TMC261 an optimum choice for drives where a high reliability is desired at a low cost. The new patented spreadCycle PWM mixed decay chopper scheme ensures best zero crossing performance as well as high speed operation. TMC261 can be driven with Step & Direction signals as well as by serial SPI interface. Using the microPlyer allows to operate the motor with highest 256 \u00b5Step smoothness reducing the input frequency to 16 \u00b5Steps. A full set of protection and diagnostic features makes this device very rugged. It directly drives stepper motors with up to 2A. This way it reaches highest energy efficiency and allows driving of a high motor current without cooling measures even at high environment temperatures.Special FeaturesStallGuard2\u2122CoolStep\u2122SpreadCycle\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "1", "Motor Supply": "9\u202660V", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "SPI": "Yes", "Step/Dir": "Yes", "StallGuard2\u2122": "Yes", "CoolStep\u2122": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "Phase Current, RMS": "1.4A", "Package": "LQFP44 (10x10)"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Images/tmc261-PA.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Blockdiagrams/TMC261-V2.svg", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Pinouts/TMC261.svg"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["TMC261 Datasheet", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC260_datasheet_Rev2.12.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["Power dissipation calculation", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/tmc262_calculations.xls"], ["Getting started", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC260_and_TMC261_Getting_started.pdf"]], "Application Notes": [["Application Note 016 - TMC429 TMC26x Getting Started: Motion Control via S/D", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Appnotes/AN016_TMC429_TMC26x_Getting_Started_01.pdf"], ["Application Note 040 - Understanding EMC TMC260, TMC261, TMC2660", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Appnotes/AN040-Understanding_EMC_TMC260_TMC261_TMC2660.pdf"], ["Application Note 044 - Replacing the TMC236/TMC246 by the TMC260 or TMC261", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Appnotes/AN044-Replacing_the_TMC236_or_TMC246_by_the_TMC260_or_TMC261_in_an_existing_project.pdf"], ["Application Note 005d - LQFP44", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/AN005d-IC_Package_PCB_Footprint_Guidelines_LQFP44.pdf"]], "Quality": [["Statement concerning RoHS compliance of TMC261", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Company/Quality/RoHS_ICs/TMC261_RoHS.pdf"]], "PCNs": [["PCN 2019-08-04 TMC261-PA", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/PCN-2019-08-04_TMC261-PA.pdf"]]}}
