{"model": "TMC4361A-EVAL", "excerpt": "The TMC4361A-EVAL allows you to explore all functions of the TMC4361A-LA\u00a0motion controller. Used in the TMC4361A-EVAL-KIT, which is a set of one\u00a0Landungsbr\u00fccke\u00a0interface board, an Eselsbr\u00fccke\u00a0connector\u00a0board and one TMC4361A-EVAL board,\u00a0it allows for a quick and simple start to make your motor turning, while still providing full access to all registers and full functionality and diagnostics.For diagnosis, all signals between MCU and TMC4361A are accessible with probes on the Eselsbr\u00fccke bridge board. To simplify the transfer to your own processor platform the MCU board can be disconnected. For use with an encoder, please connect VIO to encoder supply, as visualized in\u00a0the schematics.As the TMC4361A-EVAL uses the SPI interface of the Eselsbr\u00fccke and Landungsbr\u00fccke, it's best to combine this motion controller with one of the driver evaluation boards like the TMC23x, TMC24x, TMC26x, or TMC21x0-EVAL for quick testing and setup.\u00a0All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data. All settings can simply be exported for your own firmware project.More about the TMCL-IDESpecial Featuresclosed loop controlDcStep\u2122ChopSync\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Motor Supply": "", "Phase Current, RMS": "", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "a/b/n incremental": "Yes", "SPI": "Yes", "SSI": "Yes", "Step/Dir": "Yes", "closed loop control": "Yes", "DcStep\u2122": "Yes", "ChopSync\u2122": "Yes"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Images/TMC4361-EVAL.jpg", "images": null, "resource": {"Datasheet": [["TMC4361A Datasheet", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC4361A_datasheet_rev1.26_01.pdf"], ["TMC4361A Datasheet - Chinese Version", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC4361A-LA_Datasheet_V1.24_CN.pdf"]], "Drawings": [["EAGLE Files V1.0", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Drawings/TMC4361A-EVAL_v10_EAGLE_filesV10.ZIP"], ["Layout Data (PDF) V1.0", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Drawings/TMC4361A-EVAL_PCB_Data_V10.zip"]], "Additional Resources": [["Blog article: How to drive a stepper motor closed-loop with your Arduino Uno using a TMC4361-EVAL + TMC2130-EVAL", "https://trinamic.comhttp://blog.trinamic.com/2017/06/27/how-to-drive-a-stepper-motor-closed-loop-with-your-arduino-uno-using-a-tmc4361a-eval-tmc2130-eval/"]]}}
