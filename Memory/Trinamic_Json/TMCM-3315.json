{"model": "TMCM-3315", "excerpt": "The TMCM-3315 is a triple axis stepper motor controller/driver module for sensorless load dependent current control. The device is powered by Trinamic StallGuard2\u2122, CoolStep\u2122, SpreadCycle\u2122, StealthChop2\u2122 technology and has a SixPoint\u2122 and S-shaped ramp generator. The TMCM-3315 is capable of driving up to 9.5A of current from each output (with proper heatsinking). It is designed for an operating voltage of 18...53V. The device provides a USB, EtherCAT and 3 encoder interfaces. An integrated protocol processor supplies a high level CANopen over EtherCAT communication.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data.More about the TMCL-IDESpecial Featuresclosed loop controlCoolStep\u2122SpreadCycle\u2122StallGuard2\u2122StealthChop2\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "3", "Motor Supply": "18\u202653V", "Phase Current, RMS": "6.7A", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "EtherCAT\u00ae": "Yes", "USB": "Yes", "CoE": "Yes", "S-shaped": "Yes", "SixPoint\u2122": "Yes", "closed loop control": "Yes", "CoolStep\u2122": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "StallGuard2\u2122": "Yes", "StealthChop2\u2122": "Yes", "Width": "280mm", "Length": "100mm", "Height": ""}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Images/TMCM-3315.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Blockdiagrams/TMCM-3315.svg"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Hardware Manual Rev 1.11", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-3315_hardware_manual_hw2.00_rev1.11.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["CoE Firmware Manual FW V1.09 Rev 1.08", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-3315_CoE_firmware_manual_Fw1.09_Rev1.07_01.pdf"]], "Software": [["CoE Firmware V1.09", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-3315-CoE_V109.zip"]], "Drawings": [["STEP-File V2.0", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Drawings/TMCM-3315_V20.step"]], "PCNs": [["PCN 2019-06-02 CoE Firmware V1.09", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/PCN_2019-06-02_Firmware_V109_CoE.pdf"]], "EtherCAT Conformance Certificate": [["Certificate of EtherCAT Conformance Test", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/EtherCAT_Conformance_Certificates/TMCM-3314-TMCM-3315-Certificate-EtherCAT-Conformance.pdf"]]}}
