{"model": "TMC4671-LEV-REF", "excerpt": "TMC4671-LEV-REF is an open source reference design for LEVs (Light Electric Vehicles). It is a BLDC servo driver for voltages up to +55V (ca. 13S) and up to 500W motor power. It offers a wide range of connectivity to external sensors, position feedback systems, and GPIO as well as supports external lights on the LEV. A CAN and a TTL UART interface are available for communication.Special Featuresclosed loop controlFOCposition modevelocity modedual encoderbreak before make", "fields": {"Status": "preview", "Motor Supply": "0\u202655V", "Phase Current, RMS": "", "Microsteps": "", "Analog Hall": "Yes", "CAN": "Yes", "UART": "Yes", "GPIO": "Yes", "Torque Sensor": "Yes", "TMCL\u2122": "Yes", "closed loop control": "Yes", "FOC": "Yes", "position mode": "Yes", "velocity mode": "Yes", "dual encoder": "Yes", "break before make": "Yes"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Images/TMC4671-LEV-REF.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Images/TMC4671-LEV-REF_block_diagram.svg"], "resource": {"Documentation": [["Hardware and Firmware Manual for Firmware V1.0", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Documents/TMC4671-LEV-REF_datasheet_hw1.00_fw1.00_rev1.00.pdf"]], "Datasheet": [["TMC4671 Datasheet", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC4671-LA_datasheet_Rev2.05.pdf"], ["TMC6200 Datasheet", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC6200_datasheet_Rev1.06.pdf"]], "Drawings": [["STEP File V1.0", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Drawings/TMC4671-LEV-REF_V10_3D_STEP.zip"], ["ECAD Files V1.0 (PADS)", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Drawings/ECAD_TMC4671-LEV-REF_V10_PADS.zip"]], "Software": [["TMCL Firmware V1.00", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Software/TMC4671-LEV-REF_Hw1.0_Fw1.00.hex"]]}}
