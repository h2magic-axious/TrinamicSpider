{"model": "TMC7300-EVAL", "excerpt": "The TMC7300-EVAL allows you to explore all functions of the\u00a0TMC7300-LA.The TMC7300-EVAL-KIT is a set of one MCU board\u00a0Landungsbr\u00fccke, a\u00a0Eselsbr\u00fccke\u00a0bridge board and one TMC7300-EVAL driver board. It allows for a quick and simple start within only minutes to make your motor turning, while still providing full access to all registers and full functionality and diagnostics.For diagnosis, all signals between MCU and TMC7300\u00a0are accessible with probes on the bridge board. TMC7300-EVAL can be used with or without the Landungsbr\u00fccke\u00a0MCU board. Comprehensive sample code can be found in Trinamics Technology Access Package\u00a0TTAP.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data. All settings can simply be exported for your own firmware project.More about the TMCL-IDEPlease use the latest nightly build version of the Landungsbr\u00fccke firmware when using the TMC2300-EVAL, which you can find here:Trinamic GitHub", "fields": {"Status": "Active", "Motor Supply": "2\u202611V", "Phase Current, RMS": "2.0A", "Microsteps": "", "UART": "Yes", "PWM (internal)": "Yes", "Current Limiter": "Yes", "Single & Dual Motor Option": "Yes", "Direct Phase Control": "Yes"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Images/TMC7300-EVAL.jpg", "images": null, "resource": {"Datasheet": [["TMC7300 Datasheet", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC7300_Datasheet_V105.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["User Manual Rev 1.00", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Documents/TMC7300-EVAL_user_manual_rev1.00.pdf"], ["TMC7300-EVAL BOM V1.1", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Documents/TMC7300-Eval_v1.1_-_BOM.xlsx"]], "Drawings": [["CAD Files V1.1", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Drawings/TMC7300-EVAL_CAD_Files_V1.1.zip"], ["Fabrication Data V1.1", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Drawings/TMC7300-EVAL_Fabrication_Data_V1.1.zip"], ["Layout Data (PDF) V1.1", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Drawings/TMC7300-EVAL_Layout_Data__PDF__V1.1.zip"]]}}
