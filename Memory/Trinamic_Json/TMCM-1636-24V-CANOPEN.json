{"model": "TMCM-1636-24V-CANOPEN", "excerpt": "The TMCM-1636 is a single axis servo drive for 3-phase BLDC motors and DC motors with up to ca. 1000W running at +24V or +48V. It offers a CAN & UART interface with either TMCL or CANopen protocol for communication. TMCM-1636 supports various positions feedback options: 2x incremental quadrature encoders, analog encoder, digital HALL sensor, absolute SPI- and SSI-based encoders. Customization of firmware and hardware is possible.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data.More about the TMCL-IDE", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "1", "Motor Supply": "12\u202628V", "CAN": "Yes", "SPI": "Yes", "SSI": "Yes", "GPIO": "Yes", "TMCL\u2122": "", "CANopen": "Yes", "Width": "45mm", "Length": "90mm", "Height": "18mm"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Images/TMCM-1636_Complete.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Blockdiagrams/TMCM-1636_Blockdiagramm.svg"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Hardware Manual", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1636_hardware_manual_Hw1.1_Rev1.20.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["CANopen Firmware Manual for Firmware V1.09 Rev V1.01", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1636_CANopen_firmware_manual_Fw1.09_Rev1.01.pdf"], ["TMCL Firmware Manual for Firmware V1.09 Rev V1.01", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1636_TMCL_firmware_manual_Fw1.09_Rev1.01_01.pdf"]], "Software": [["CANopen and TMCL Firmware V1.09 (hex and EDS file)", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1636-Hw1.1_Fw1.09.zip"]], "Drawings": [["TMCM-1636 Step Files V1.1", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Drawings/TMCM-1636_STEP_V11.zip"]]}}
