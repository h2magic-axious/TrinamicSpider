{"model": "TMCM-1637-TMCL", "excerpt": "The TMCM-1637 is a single axis field oriented motor controller/driver board. It supports single phase DC motors, two phase bipolar stepper motors and three phase BLDC motors with up to 5A RMS (7A peak) motor coil current. For motor commutation and position feedback, hall sensors or incremental ABN encoders can be used. For driver-only applications, the TMCM-1637 offers Step/Direction inputs. The TMCM-1637 is also equipped with two analog inputs (0... 5V range), two digital inputs and two digital (TTL level) outputs. For communication, RS485 and CAN bus interfaces are available.", "fields": {"Status": "preview", "Axes": "1", "Motor Supply": "10\u202630V", "a/b/n incremental": "Yes", "CAN": "Yes", "RS485": "Yes", "Step/Dir": "Yes", "GPIO": "Yes", "Digital Hall": "Yes", "CANopen": "", "TMCL\u2122": "Yes", "Width": "45mm", "Length": "80mm", "Height": "7mm"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Images/TMCM-1637_V12.jpg", "images": null, "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Hardware Manual", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1637_hardware_manual_hw1.2_rev1.02.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["TMCL Firmware Manual for Firmware V1.09", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1637_TMCL_firmware_manual_fw1.09_rev1.00.pdf"], ["CANopen Firmware Manual for Firmware V1.09", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1637_CANopen_firmware_manual_fw1.09_rev1.00.pdf"]], "Software": [["TMCL Firmware V1.09", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1637_TMCL_V109.hex"], ["CANopen Firmware V1.09", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1637_CANopen_V109.zip"]]}}
