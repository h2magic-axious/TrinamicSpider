{"model": "TMC8460-EVAL", "excerpt": "The TMC8460-EVAL allows you to explore all functions of the TMC8460-BI. TMC8460 is a EtherCAT\u00a0slave controller IC with integrated, jitter-free realtime motion-control peripherals.The TMC8460-EVAL board allows for a quick and simple start within only minutes to make your motor turning, while still providing full access to all registers and full functionality and diagnostics.For diagnosis, all signals between MCU and TMC8460 are accessible with probes on the Eselsbr\u00fccke\u00a0bridge board.To enable wide interoperability, the TMC8460 communication hardware has been verified as 100% compatible with the existing Beckhoff EtherCAT Slave controller through extensive interoperability testing.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data. All settings can simply be exported for your own firmware project.More about the TMCL-IDE", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Motor Supply": "", "Phase Current, RMS": "", "Microsteps": "", "a/b/n incremental": "Yes", "EtherCAT\u00ae": "Yes", "PWM": "Yes", "SPI": "Yes", "Step/Dir": "Yes"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Images/TMC8460-EVAL.jpg", "images": null, "resource": {"Datasheet": [["TMC8460 Datasheet", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC8460_datasheet.pdf"], ["TMC8460-EVAL Datasheet", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Documents/TMC8460-Eval_datasheet_V100.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["TMC8460-EVAL BOM V1.3", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Documents/TMC8460-Eval_v13_BOM.csv"]], "Drawings": [["EAGLE Files V1.3", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Drawings/TMC8460-Eval-EAGLE_Files_V1.3.ZIP"], ["GERBER Files V1.3", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Drawings/TMC8460-Eval-GERBER_Files_V1.3.zip"], ["Layout Data (PDF) V1.3", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Drawings/TMC8460-Eval-Layout_Data_V1.3.zip"]], "Application Notes": [["Application Note 054 - EtherCAT using realtime TC3", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Appnotes/AN054_Ethercat_using_realtime_TC3.pdf"]], "Software": [["TMC8460-EVAL device emulation", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Documents/TMC8460-Eval_Device_Emulation.xml"], ["TMC8460-ECAD", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC8460-ECAD_Rev1.00.zip"], ["Trinamic Evaluation Board", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Software/TrinamicEvaluationBoard.xml"], ["Startrampe Firmware for TMC846x", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Software/Startrampe-TMC846x.hex"], ["Landungsbr\u00fccke Firmware for TMC846x", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Software/Landungsbruecke-TMC846x.hex"]]}}
