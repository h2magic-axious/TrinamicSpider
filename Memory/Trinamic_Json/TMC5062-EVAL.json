{"model": "TMC5062-EVAL", "excerpt": "The TMC5062-EVAL allows you to explore all functions of the TMC5062-LA.The TMC5062-EVAL-KIT is a set of one MCU board Landungsbr\u00fccke, an Eselsbr\u00fccke bridge board and one TMC5062-EVAL driver board. It allows for a quick and simple start within only minutes to make your motor turning, while still providing full access to all registers and full functionality and diagnostics.For diagnosis, all signals between MCU and TMC5062 are accessible with probes on the Eselsbr\u00fccke bridge board. To simplify the transfer to your own processor platform the MCU board can be disconnected.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data. All settings can simply be exported for your own firmware project.More about the TMCL-IDEThe proven and tested design files of the Evaluation Board can be downloaded free of charge and used or replicated without any restrictions. The Design is thermally optimized and approved.Special FeaturesDcStep\u2122microstep tableChopSync\u2122CoolStep\u2122short detectionSpreadCycle\u2122Stall detectionStallGuard2\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Motor Supply": "5\u202620V", "Phase Current, RMS": "1.1A", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "USB": "Yes", "DcStep\u2122": "Yes", "microstep table": "Yes", "ChopSync\u2122": "Yes", "CoolStep\u2122": "Yes", "short detection": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "Stall detection": "Yes", "StallGuard2\u2122": "Yes"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Images/TMC5062-EVAL.jpg", "images": null, "resource": {"Datasheet": [["TMC5062-LA Datasheet", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC5062_datasheet_Rev1.12.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["TMC5062-EVAL BOM V1.2", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Drawings/TMC5062-EVAL_v12_BOM.xlsx"]], "Drawings": [["EAGLE Files V1.2", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Drawings/TMC5062-EVAL_v12_EAGLE_files.zip"], ["Layout Data (PDF) V1.2", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Documents/TMC5062-EVAL_PCB_Data_V1.2.zip"]], "Software": [["TMC-EVAL.inf", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Software/TMC-EVAL.inf"]]}}
