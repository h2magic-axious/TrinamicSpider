{"model": "TMC6100-LA", "excerpt": "The TMC6100 is a high-power gate-driver for PMSM servo or BLDC motors. Using six external MOSFETs it controls motors from Watt to Kilowatt. Software controlled drive strength allows insystem EME optimization. Programmable safety features like short detection and overtemperature thresholds together with an SPI interface for diagnostics allow robust and reliable designs. With the TMC6100, a minimum number of external components is required to build a rugged drive with full protection and diagnostics.Special Featuresbreak before make", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "1", "Motor Supply": "8\u202660V", "Microsteps": "", "PWM": "Yes", "SPI": "Yes", "break before make": "Yes", "Phase Current, RMS": "10.0A", "Package": "QFN37 (7x7)"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Images/TMC6100-LA.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Blockdiagrams/TMC6100_Block_Diagram.svg", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Pinouts/Pinout_TMC6100-LA.svg"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Datasheet Rev 1.01", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC6100_datasheet_Rev1.01.pdf"]]}}
