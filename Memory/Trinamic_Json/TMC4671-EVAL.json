{"model": "TMC4671-EVAL", "excerpt": "The TMC4671-EVAL allows you to explore all functions of the TMC4671-LA.The TMC4671+TMC-UPS-10A70V-EVAL-KIT is a set of one MCU board Landungsbr\u00fccke, two Eselsbr\u00fccke bridge boards and a TMC-UPS-10A70V-A-EVAL power stage as well as one TMC4671-EVAL driver board. In addition we recommend to use the USB adapter for real-time-monitoring interface (RTMI): USB-2-RTMI.The complete set allows for a quick and simple start within only minutes to make your motor turning, while still providing full access to all registers and full functionality and diagnostics. For diagnosis, all signals between MCU and TMC4671 are accessible with probes on the Eselsbr\u00fccke bridge board. To simplify the transfer to your own processor platform the MCU board can be disconnected.\u00a0All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data. All settings can simply be exported for your own firmware project.More about the TMCL-IDEIf you like to see a step by step guide on driving a linear stage with the TMC4671, please visit the blog post where one of Trinamic's Engineers explains in 3 posts how to set up your linear stage, how to tune the controller using the TMCL-IDE, and how to adapt the firmware to your own project.Quick Setup GuideSpecial Featuresclosed loop controlFOCposition modevelocity modedual encoder", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Motor Supply": "", "Phase Current, RMS": "", "Microsteps": "", "SPI": "Yes", "UART": "Yes", "closed loop control": "Yes", "FOC": "Yes", "position mode": "Yes", "velocity mode": "Yes", "dual encoder": "Yes"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Images/TMC4671-EVAL_V1.2.jpg", "images": null, "resource": {"Datasheet": [["TMC4671-LA Datasheet", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC4671-LA_datasheet_Rev2.05.pdf"], ["TMC4671-ES Datasheet", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC4671_datasheet_v1.06.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["User Manual Rev 1.20", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Documents/TMC4671-EVAL_user_manual_rev1.10.pdf"], ["User Manual Rev 1.10", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Documents/TMC4671-EVAL_user_manual_Rev1.0_HW1.1.pdf"]], "Drawings": [["TMC4671-EVAL Design Files HW V1.2", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Drawings/TMC4671-EVAL_Rev1.2.zip"], ["TMC4671-EVAL Design Files HW V1.1", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Drawings/TMC4671-EVAL_Rev1.1.zip"]], "Application Notes": [["Application Note 025 - DC Motor Control with TMC4671", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Appnotes/AN025-DC_Motor_Control_with_TMC4671.pdf"], ["Application Note 053 - TMC4671 PI Tuning", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Appnotes/AN053_TMC4671-PI_Tuning.pdf"], ["Application Note 053 - TMC4671 PI Tuning (Chinese Version)", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Appnotes/AN053_-_TMC4671-PI_Tuning_CN.pdf"]], "Additional Resources": [["Blog article: Driving a linear stage with the TMC4671 - Setup", "https://trinamic.comhttps://blog.trinamic.com/2020/02/25/driving-a-linear-stage-with-the-tmc4671/"], ["Blog article: Driving a linear stage with the TMC4671 - Controller tuning", "https://trinamic.comhttps://blog.trinamic.com/2020/02/26/driving-a-linear-stage-with-the-tmc4671-controller-tuning/"], ["Blog article: Driving a linear stage with the TMC4671 - Firmware adaptation", "https://trinamic.comhttps://blog.trinamic.com/2020/02/28/driving-a-linear-stage-with-the-tmc4671-firmware-adaptation/"]]}}
