{"model": "TMCM-6110", "excerpt": "The TMCM-6110 is a six-axis stepper motor controller/driver module for sensorless load dependent current control. The device is powered by Trinamic StallGuard2\u2122, CoolStep\u2122 and SpreadCycle\u2122 technology and has a trapezoidal ramp generator. The TMCM-6110 is capable of driving up to 1.6A of current from each output (with proper heatsinking). It is designed for an operating voltage of 9...28V. The device provides RS485, CAN and USB interfaces. An integrated protocol processor supplies a high level TMCL communication.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data.More about the TMCL-IDESpecial FeaturesStallGuard2\u2122CoolStep\u2122SpreadCycle\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "6", "Motor Supply": "9\u202628V", "Phase Current, RMS": "1.1A", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "CAN": "Yes", "RS485": "Yes", "USB": "Yes", "TMCL\u2122": "Yes", "trapezoidal": "Yes", "StallGuard2\u2122": "Yes", "CoolStep\u2122": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "Width": "130mm", "Length": "100mm", "Height": "30mm"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Images/TMCM-6110_1_.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Blockdiagrams/TMCM-6110_Blockdiagramm.svg"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Hardware Manual Rev 1.14", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-6110_hardware_manual_hw1.10_rev1.14.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["TMCL Firmware Manual Revision V1.17 for Firmware V1.42", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-6110_TMCL_firmware_manual_Fw1.42_Rev1.17.pdf"]], "Software": [["Setup Information (Trinamic_inf_cat)", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Software/Trinamic_inf_cat.zip"], ["Firmware V1.42", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-6110_V142.hex"], ["Firmware V1.35", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-6110_V135.hex"], ["Firmware V1.31", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-6110_V131.hex"], ["Firmware V1.26", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-6110_V126.hex"], ["Firmware V1.24", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-6110_V124.hex"], ["Firmware V1.21", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-6110_V121.hex"], ["Firmware V1.20", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-6110_V120.hex"]], "Drawings": [["STEP-File V1.1", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Drawings/TMCM-6110_V11.stp"]], "PCNs": [["PCN_2017-03-01_TMCM-6110_V1.42", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/PCN_2017-03-01_TMCM-6110_V142.pdf"]]}}
