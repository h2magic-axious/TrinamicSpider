{"model": "TMC4671-BOB", "excerpt": "The TMC4671 breakout board is a development board with the dedicated TMC4671. It is designed to give users the chance to rapidly prototype their applications - making it possible to immediately check how the motor performs with TMC chips while developing the application's software.\u00a0If you like to see a step by step guide on driving a linear stage with the TMC4671, please visit the blog post where one of Trinamic's Engineers explains in 3 posts how to set up your linear stage, how to tune the controller using the TMCL-IDE, and how to adapt the firmware to your own project.Visit the blog postSpecial Featuresclosed loop controlFOCposition modevelocity modedual encoder", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Motor Supply": "", "Phase Current, RMS": "", "Microsteps": "", "a/b/n incremental": "Yes", "SPI": "Yes", "UART": "Yes", "closed loop control": "Yes", "FOC": "Yes", "position mode": "Yes", "velocity mode": "Yes", "dual encoder": "Yes"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Images/TMC-4671-BOB_V1.2_retouched.jpg", "images": null, "resource": {"Datasheet": [["TMC4671-LA Datasheet", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC4671-LA_datasheet_Rev2.05.pdf"], ["TMC4671-ES Datasheet", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC4671_datasheet_v1.06.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["TMC4671-BOB Manual HW V1.4", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Documents/TMC4671-BOB_datasheet_Rev1.2_HW1.4.pdf"], ["TMC4671-BOB Manual HW V1.1", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Documents/TMC4671-BOB_datasheet_Rev1.0_HW1.2.pdf"]], "Drawings": [["TMC4671-BOB Design Files HW V1.4", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Drawings/TMC4671-BOB_Rev1.4.zip"], ["TMC4671-BOB Design Files HW V1.1", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Eval_Drawings/TMC4671-BOB_V1.1.zip"]], "Application Notes": [["Application Note 025 - DC Motor Control with TMC4671", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Appnotes/AN025-DC_Motor_Control_with_TMC4671.pdf"], ["Application Note 053 - TMC4671 PI Tuning", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Appnotes/AN053_TMC4671-PI_Tuning.pdf"], ["Application Note 053 - TMC4671 PI Tuning (Chinese Version)", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Appnotes/AN053_-_TMC4671-PI_Tuning_CN.pdf"]]}}
