{"model": "TMC4671-LA", "excerpt": "The TMC4671 is a fully integrated servo controller, providing Field Oriented Control (FOC) for BLDC/PMSM and 2-phase stepper motors as well as DC motors and voice coils. All control functions are implemented in hardware. Integrated ADCs, position sensor interfaces, position interpolators, enable a fully functional servo controller for a wide range of servo applications.If you like to see a step by step guide on driving a linear stage with the TMC4671, please visit the blog post where one of Trinamic's Engineers explains in 3 posts how to set up your linear stage, how to tune the controller using the TMCL-IDE, and how to adapt the firmware to your own project.Quick Setup GuideSpecial Featuresclosed loop controlFOCposition modevelocity modedual encoder", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "1", "a/b/n incremental": "Yes", "Analog Hall": "Yes", "PWM": "Yes", "SPI": "Yes", "UART": "Yes", "GPIO": "Yes", "Step/Dir": "Yes", "closed loop control": "Yes", "FOC": "Yes", "position mode": "Yes", "velocity mode": "Yes", "dual encoder": "Yes", "Package": "QFN76 (10.5x6.5)"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Images/TMC4671-LA.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Blockdiagrams/TMC4671_Block_Diagram.svg", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Pinouts/TMC4671_Pinning.svg"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Datasheet Rev 2.05", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC4671-LA_datasheet_Rev2.05.pdf"]], "Application Notes": [["AN 025 - DC Motor Control with TMC4671", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Appnotes/AN025-DC_Motor_Control_with_TMC4671.pdf"], ["AN 053 - TMC4671 PI Tuning", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Appnotes/AN053_TMC4671-PI_Tuning.pdf"], ["AN 053 - TMC4671 PI Tuning (Chinese Version)", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Appnotes/AN053_-_TMC4671-PI_Tuning_CN.pdf"]], "Quality": [["Statement concerning RoHS compliance of TMC4671", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Company/Quality/RoHS_ICs/TMC4671_RoHS.pdf"]], "PCNs": [["PCN 2020-04-20 TMC4671-ES to TMC4671-LA", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/EOL_PCN/PCN_2020-04-20_TMC4671.pdf"]], "Additional Resources": [["Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)", "https://trinamic.comhttps://www.trinamic.com/support/faq/#SpecificProducts"], ["Application Programming Interface (API)", "https://trinamic.comhttps://www.trinamic.com/support/software/access-package/"], ["Blog article: Driving a linear stage with the TMC4671 - Setup", "https://trinamic.comhttps://blog.trinamic.com/2020/02/25/driving-a-linear-stage-with-the-tmc4671/"], ["Blog article: Driving a linear stage with the TMC4671 - Controller tuning", "https://trinamic.comhttps://blog.trinamic.com/2020/02/26/driving-a-linear-stage-with-the-tmc4671-controller-tuning/"], ["Blog article: Driving a linear stage with the TMC4671 - Firmware adaptation", "https://trinamic.comhttps://blog.trinamic.com/2020/02/28/driving-a-linear-stage-with-the-tmc4671-firmware-adaptation/"]]}}
