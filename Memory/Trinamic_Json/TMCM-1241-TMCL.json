{"model": "TMCM-1241-TMCL", "excerpt": "The TMCM-1241 is a single axis motor controller/driver board for 2-phase bipolar stepper motors with up-to 3A RMS (4.3A peak) motor coil current. It supports linear ramps and unique SixPoint\u2122 ramps. It offers on-board SensOstep encoder and in addition, support for connection of external (incremental A/B) encoder. For driver-only applications, the TMCM-1241 offers optically isolated Step/Direction inputs.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data.More about the TMCL-IDESpecial FeaturesCoolStep\u2122SpreadCycle\u2122StallGuard2\u2122StealthChop\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "1", "Motor Supply": "10\u202630V", "Phase Current, RMS": "3.0A", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "a/b/n incremental": "Yes", "CAN": "Yes", "RS485": "Yes", "Step/Dir": "Yes", "USB": "Yes", "GPIO": "Yes", "SensOstep\u2122": "Yes", "TMCL\u2122": "Yes", "CANopen": "", "SixPoint\u2122": "Yes", "CoolStep\u2122": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "StallGuard2\u2122": "Yes", "StealthChop\u2122": "Yes", "Width": "37mm", "Length": "37mm", "Height": "11mm"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Images/TMCM-1241.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Blockdiagrams/TMCM-1241_Blockdiagramm_v2.svg"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Hardware Manual Rev 1.21", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1241_hardware_manual_hw1.00_rev1.21.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["TMCL Firmware Manual for Firmware V1.44", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1241_TMCL_firmware_manual_Fw1.44_Rev1.01.pdf"], ["CANopen Firmware Manual for Firmware V3.21", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1241_CANopen_firmware_manual_Fw3.21_Rev1.00.pdf"]], "Software": [["TMCL Firmware V1.44", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1241_TMCL_V144.hex"], ["CANopen Firmware V3.21 (hex and EDS file)", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1241_CANopen_V321.zip"]], "Drawings": [["STEP-File V10", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1241_V10.step"]]}}
