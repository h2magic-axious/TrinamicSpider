{"model": "TMC4361A-LA", "excerpt": "The TMC4361 is a stepper motor servo controller with S-shaped ramps for laboratory automation, 3D-Printing, Scanners and other automated equipment applications. The device is usable as a trapezoidal and advanced SixPoint\u2122 ramp generator. Furthermore the TMC4361 is powered by Trinamic DcStep\u2122, closed loop control and ChopSync\u2122 technology. The device is designed for an operating voltage of 3.3V or 5V. The TMC4361 provides a SPI controller and SPI, S/D driver interface. Additionally it has an a/b/n incremental, SPI and SSI encoder interface.Special Featuresclosed loop controlDcStep\u2122ChopSync\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "1", "Motor Supply": "", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "a/b/n incremental": "Yes", "PWM": "Yes", "SPI": "Yes", "SSI": "Yes", "Step/Dir": "Yes", "advanced S-shaped": "Yes", "SixPoint\u2122": "Yes", "trapezoidal": "Yes", "closed loop control": "Yes", "DcStep\u2122": "Yes", "ChopSync\u2122": "Yes", "Phase Current, RMS": "", "Package": "QFN40 (6x6)"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Images/tmc4361a-la-preliminary.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Blockdiagrams/TMC4361A_Blockdiagramm-V3.svg", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Pinouts/TMC4361.svg"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Datasheet Rev 1.26", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC4361A_datasheet_rev1.26_01.pdf"], ["Datasheet - Chinese Version", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC4361A-LA_Datasheet_V1.24_CN.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["Calculation Sheet", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/SRamp_Calcs_TMC43xx.xlsx"]], "Application Notes": [["AN 005j - PCB Footprint Guidelines QFN40 6x6", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/AN005j-IC_Package_PCB_Footprint_Guidelines_QFN40_6x6.pdf"], ["AN 032 - TMC4361A closed-loop motor control for stepper motor drivers", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Appnotes/AN032_TMC4361A_closed_loop_motor_control.pdf"]], "Additional Resources": [["Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)", "https://trinamic.comhttps://www.trinamic.com/support/faq/#SpecificProducts"], ["Application Programming Interface (API)", "https://trinamic.comhttps://www.trinamic.com/support/software/access-package/"]]}}
