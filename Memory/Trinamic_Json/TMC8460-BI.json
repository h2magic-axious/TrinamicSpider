{"model": "TMC8460-BI", "excerpt": "The TMC8460 is an EtherCAT slave controller with multifunction I/O for industrial automation, robotics and other automated equipment applications. The device is suitable as a step/ direction output and SPI master for example without using an additional microcontroller. The TMC8460 provides an a/b/n incremental, PWM, SPI and step/direction interface, general purpose IOs, and connects to the EtherCAT\u00ae field bus with two MII interfaces. The device requires 1.2V and 3.3V for logic and IO supply.", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "", "Motor Supply": "", "Microsteps": "", "a/b/n incremental": "Yes", "PWM": "Yes", "SPI": "Yes", "Step/Dir": "Yes", "GPIO": "Yes", "2x MII": "Yes", "Distributed Clocks": "Yes", "Phase Current, RMS": "", "Package": "BGA VFGG400 (17x17)"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Images/tmc8460-bi.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Blockdiagrams/TMC8460-V2.svg"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["TMC8460 Datasheet", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC8460_datasheet.pdf"]], "Application Notes": [["Application Note 054 - EtherCAT using realtime TC3", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Appnotes/AN054_Ethercat_using_realtime_TC3.pdf"]], "Quality": [["Statement concerning RoHS compliance of TMC8460", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Company/Quality/RoHS_ICs/TMC8460_RoHS.pdf"]]}}
