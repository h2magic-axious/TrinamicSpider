{"model": "TMC5161-AA", "excerpt": "The TMC5161 is a highly compact stepper motor controller and driver IC. Its power stage is optimized for lowest power dissipation and highest dynamics with Nema 17 and Nema 23 motors. Based on Trinamic's sophisticated SpreadCycle\u2122 and StealthChop\u2122 choppers, it ensures absolutely noiseless operation combined with maximum efficiency and best motor torque. High integration, high energy efficiency and a small form factor enable miniaturized and scalable systems for cost effective solutions.Special FeaturesDcStep\u2122velocity modeCoolStep\u2122passive brakingSpreadCycle\u2122Stall detectionStallGuard2\u2122StealthChop2\u2122MicroPlyer\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "on hold", "Axes": "1", "Motor Supply": "8\u202640V", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "a/b/n incremental": "Yes", "SPI": "Yes", "Step/Dir": "Yes", "UART": "Yes", "SixPoint\u2122": "Yes", "DcStep\u2122": "Yes", "velocity mode": "Yes", "MicroPlyer\u2122": "Yes", "CoolStep\u2122": "Yes", "passive braking": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "Stall detection": "Yes", "StallGuard2\u2122": "Yes", "StealthChop2\u2122": "Yes", "Phase Current, RMS": "3.5A", "Package": "AQFN (10x10)"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Images/TMC5161-AA.png", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Blockdiagrams/TMC5161_Block_Diagram.svg"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Datasheet Rev 1.06", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC5161_datasheet_rev1.06.pdf"]], "Application Notes": [["AN 028 - Extending Positioning Range TMC5xxx", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Support/Appnotes/AN028-Extending_the_positioning_range_of_TMC5XXX.pdf"]], "Quality": [["Statement concerning RoHS compliance of TMC5161", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Company/Quality/RoHS_ICs/TMC5161_RoHS.pdf"]], "Additional Resources": [["Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)", "https://trinamic.comhttps://www.trinamic.com/support/faq/"], ["Application Programming Interface (API)", "https://trinamic.comhttps://www.trinamic.com/support/software/access-package/"]], "Documentation": [["TMC5161 Calculations", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC5161_Calculations.xlsx"]], "Drawings": [["TMC5161 PADS", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC5161_PADS.zip"]]}}
