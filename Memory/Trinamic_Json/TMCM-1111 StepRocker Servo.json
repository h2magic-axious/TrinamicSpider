{"model": "TMCM-1111 StepRocker Servo", "excerpt": "The TMCM-1111-StepRocker Servo is a single axis stepper motor controller/driver module for closed loop stepper motor servos. The device is powered by Trinamic StallGuard2\u2122, CoolStep\u2122 and SpreadCycle\u2122 chopper technology and has a S-shaped ramp generator. The TMCM-1111 is capable of driving up to 2.8A of current from each output. It is designed for an operating voltage of 10...30V. The device provides a RS485, USB, S/D and encoder interface. An integrated protocol processor supplies a high level TMCL communication.All you need to get started is a power supply and Trinamic's free and easy to use TMCL-IDE. This graphical user interface allows quick setup and supports the use of commands in direct mode, monitors real-time behavior visualized in graphs, and logs and stores data.More about the TMCL-IDESpecial Featuresclosed loop controlDcStep\u2122ChopSync\u2122StallGuard2\u2122CoolStep\u2122SpreadCycle\u2122", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "1", "Motor Supply": "10\u202630V", "Phase Current, RMS": "2.8A", "Microsteps": "1\u2026256", "a/b/n incremental": "Yes", "Analog Hall": "Yes", "RS485": "Yes", "Step/Dir": "Yes", "USB": "Yes", "GPIO": "Yes", "TMCL\u2122": "Yes", "advanced S-shaped": "Yes", "SixPoint\u2122": "Yes", "trapezoidal": "Yes", "closed loop control": "Yes", "DcStep\u2122": "Yes", "ChopSync\u2122": "Yes", "StallGuard2\u2122": "Yes", "CoolStep\u2122": "Yes", "SpreadCycle\u2122": "Yes", "Width": "85mm", "Length": "55mm", "Height": "15mm"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Images/TMCM-1111.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Blockdiagrams/TMCM-1111_Block_Diagram.svg"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Hardware Manual Rev 1.01", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1111_hardware_manual_hw1.10_rev1.01.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["TMCL Firmware Manual Revision V1.06 for Firmware V1.11", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1111_TMCL_firmware_manual_Fw1.11_Rev1.06.pdf"], ["TMCL Firmware Manual Revision V1.04 for Firmware V1.09", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1111_TMCL_firmware_manual_Fw1.09_Rev1.04.pdf"], ["TMCL Firmware Manual Revision V1.01 for Firmware V1.08", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1111_TMCL-firmware_manual_Fw1.08_Rev1.01.pdf"], ["TMCL-LITE Firmware Manual FW V1.00 Rev 1.00", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/TMCM-1111-TMCL-LITE_firmware_manual_fw1.00_rev1.00.pdf"]], "Software": [["TMCL Firmware V1.11", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1111_TMCL_V111.hex"], ["TMCL Firmware V1.09", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1111_TMCL_V109.hex"], ["TMCL Firmware V1.08", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCM-1111_TMCL_V108.hex"], ["TMCL-LITE Firmware", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Software/TMCL-LITE-1111.zip"]], "Drawings": [["Design Data V11", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Drawings/TMCM-1111_Design_Data_V11.zip"]], "PCNs": [["PCN 2019-06-01 TMCL Firmware V1.11", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/PCN_2019-06-01_Firmware_V111_TMCL.pdf"], ["PCN 2018-03-01 TMCL Firmware V1.09", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/Modules_Documents/PCN_2018-03-01_Firmware_V109.pdf"]]}}
