{"model": "TMC8670-BI", "excerpt": "The TMC8670 is a single-axis servo motor controller for industrial automation, embedded servo control and other automated equipment applications. It is suitable for 3-phase BLDC and 2-phase stepper motors. The device is designed for an operating voltage of 1.2V and 3.3V. The device provides an a/b/n incremental, digital hall, analog hall and analog sincos encoder interface. TMC8670 has an integrated EtherCAT slave controller and a CANopen over EtherCAT protocol processor.Special FeaturesFOCdual encoder", "fields": {"Status": "active", "Axes": "1", "Motor Supply": "1.2\u20263.3V", "Microsteps": "", "a/b/n incremental": "Yes", "Analog Hall": "Yes", "RMII (EtherCAT\u00ae)": "Yes", "SPI": "Yes", "UART": "Yes", "CoE": "Yes", "FOC": "Yes", "dual encoder": "Yes", "Phase Current, RMS": "", "Package": "FCSG325 (11x11)"}, "picture": "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Images/TMC8670-BI.jpg", "images": ["https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Blockdiagrams/TMC8670_Block_Diagram.svg"], "resource": {"Datasheet": [["Datasheet Rev 1.00", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC8670_datasheet_rev1.00.pdf"]], "Documentation": [["CoE Firmware Manual FW V1.00 Rev 1.00", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC8670_CoE_firmware_manual_fw1.00_rev1.00.pdf"]], "Software": [["TMC8670 Firmware", "https://trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Software/TMC8670_Firmware_Hw1.00_Fw1.00.zip"]]}}
